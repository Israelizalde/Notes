              there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild
              animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates
              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426-822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations
              within these felid populations further substantiates the
              postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated
              throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed
              from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have
              been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or
              delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and
              display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were
              routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to
              be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in
              order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes.",

              (87Sr/86Sr) for identifying migration within Lapita populations
              and their commensal animals, specifically the pig (Sus scrofa).
              Lapita people (ca. 3300–2200BP) were the initial colonists of the
              island groups to the east of the Solomon Islands, spreading from
              Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa within a few centuries.
              Mobility is assumed to have been an important mechanism for
              maintaining cultural solidarity between Lapita communities. It has
              been previously argued that Lapita populations became
              progressively more sedentary over time after the initial
              colonising events. Two Lapita sites, Kamgot and Balbalankin, from
              the Anir Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago are included in the
              analysis and fall within the Early (ca. 3300–3000/2900BP) and
              Middle (ca. 3000/2900–2700BP) Lapita periods respectively. Ten
              tooth enamel samples from Lapita human and pig teeth as well as
              modern teeth were analysed for strontium isotopes. The mean values
              for the individuals from both sites were higher than the
              geological value obtained for the Anir Islands reflecting the
              incorporation of marine-derived strontium into their tooth enamel
              taken up in their diet. Although the sample sites have similar
              environments there was a difference between the local ranges of
              the strontium isotopic data. One Lapita age pig and one
              potentially modern pig from Kamgot fell well outside the local
              distribution for the site and were considered to be non-local. The
              extreme distribution of the two outliers suggests they came from
              two geographically separate locations. The results from the Anir
              Islands when compared with strontium results from other
              prehistoric Pacific Island populations suggest there is sufficient
              variation between island groups in terms of the biologically
              available strontium to justify further research. The present
              results are discussed in terms of using pigs as a proxy for human
              mobility as well as an indicator for the ‘local’ range of an
              archaeological population by treating human and pigs as separate
              populations. Strontium isotopes therefore provide the opportunity
              to investigate migration in Lapita populations on a finer scale
              than was previously possible.",

              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1-550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma's zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the

              geographic or habitat ranges. Isotopic analysis provides an
              additional means of identifying and sourcing non-local animals.
              87Sr/86Sr values from Maya zooarchaeological remains indicate that
              regional and long-distance transport and exchange of animal goods
              was more common than previously recognized. Widely distributed
              animals including deer and peccary were among the animals
              exchanged, which questions their common interpretation as
              locally-acquired resources. The isotopic results contribute to our
              understanding of how animal products were integrated into Maya
              economic and exchange networks. The research is also relevant to
              human mobility studies in Mesoamerica.",

              whether the Paquimeños actively bred these parrots or traded with

              four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using
              strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium,
              commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both
              producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present
              methodological challenges that researchers must carefully
              consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many
              archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant
              materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable
              strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if
              applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the
              most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research
              questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide
              more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time.
              Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most
              successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements
              as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are
              both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer
              specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the

              existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically
              utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate
              metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be
              archived in one of several online databases to maximize their
              usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely
              increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping,

              isotope baselines developed from 16 archaeological faunal
              specimens from Nakum. The bone collagen carbon and nitrogen
              results indicate that the Nakum Maya consumed a maize-based diet
              supplemented with other cultigens and animal protein. Stable
              carbon isotope values from the bioapatite of five human bone and

              component throughout life, although two individuals consumed less

              conditions provide significant constraints and opportunities for
              human behavior. Paleoenvironmental studies are thus an important
              component of archaeological investigations seeking to understand
              the organization, development and decline of past societies. This
              dissertation develops a method of paleoenvironmental research that
              uses stable isotope analysis of jackrabbit and cottontail
              (Leporidae) bones to quantify aspects of the landscapes in which
              they lived. The project then applies the technique to a sample of
              bones excavated from four archaeological sites in desert
              ecosystems of North America to obtain information about
              human-leporid and human environmental relationships through time.
              Site locations include Pueblo Grande (Arizona, USA), La Ferrería
              (Durango, Mexico), La Quemada (Zacatecas, Mexico) , and
              Teotihuacan (Mexico, Mexico). Results are explored across multiple
              temporal and spatial scales to refine the method and improve our
              understanding of the long-term dynamics of social-environmental
              systems within arid and semi-arid landscapes. Results of baseline
              analyses on modern bones demonstrate significant correlations
              between stable oxygen isotope values and moisture variables
              (precipitation and humidity), and between stable carbon and
              nitrogen isotope values and temperature variables (min, max, and
              mean temperature), indicating the utility of leporids as
              paleoenvironmental proxies. Two primary conclusions result from
              analyses on archaeological specimens. First, results from La
              Ferrería leporids demonstrate changes through time suggesting a
              shift towards wetter conditions during the Las Joyas (AD 850-
              1000) phase, a period characterized by increasing population and
              new architectural construction. Importantly, these findings link
              social development in the region with environmental change.
              Secondly, results from Teotihuacan demonstrate rising carbon
              isotope values concomitant with the growth of the city, likely
              reflecting human modifications to the landscape, and falling
              carbon isotope values following its sociopolitical collapse.
              Notably, during the peak of population and complexity of
              Teotihuacan leporids from the residential complex of Oztoyahualco
              demonstrate significantly higher stable carbon isotope values than
              other contexts, supporting previous assumptions that residents
              there specialized in rabbit management or breeding. By using
              stable isotope values from jackrabbit and cottontail bones from
              modern and archaeological contexts, this dissertation improves our
              understanding of the baseline factors that influence bone isotope
              ratios and provides new information on the social-environment
              dynamics of the ancient New World",

              bone apatite samples from archaeological sites. Further effort to

               center that attracted migrants from as far away as west Mexico
               and the Maya region. Past research in the Tlajinga district at
               Teotihuacan using oxygen isotopes from human remains estimated
               that nearly 30\% of the population of Tlajinga 33, a single
               apartment compound, were migrants. This study takes a
               dual-isotope approach (87Sr/86Sr and δ18Op) to reevaluate the
               proportion of in-migration at Tlajinga and includes data from two
               additional apartment compounds, Tlajinga 17 and 18 (n = 23). New
               results indicate that migrants comprised ~45\% of the Tlajinga

              isotopic analysis of faunal remains. Stable carbon- and
              nitrogen-isotope compositions of bone collagen have been analysed
              for 24 dogs and 16 deer found in well-dated contexts from the
              prehistoric Maya lithic manufacturing community of Colha, Belize.
              The sample spans the Early Middle Preclassic period beginning
              1000–600bc to the Terminal Late Preclassic period ending around
              ad250. The majority of both dogs and deer come from middens, but
              three dogs come from cache contexts in buildings. The degree to
              which humans controlled the diets of these animals varies markedly
              by context and time period. The diets of midden dogs demonstrate a
              significant increase in the amount of C4(maize-based) foods and
              become more herbivorous over time. Because the midden dogs were
              probably dependent scavengers, this phenomenon might reflect the
              dynamics of human dietary change as the population at Colha
              expanded towards the end of the Preclassic period. An increase in
              the homogeneity of dog diets might also be indicative of either
              more restrictive human control over the animals or a reduction in
              the variability of resources used by humans. Alternatively,
              because the structure associated with the midden in which the dogs
              were found became more ceremonial in Late Preclassic times, the
              dogs from this period could be reflecting a general increase in
              purposeful feeding for ceremonial purposes. Dogs found in special
              (i.e. non-midden) contexts from both the Late Middle Preclassic
              and Late Late to Terminal Late Preclassic periods have distinctive
              isotopic signatures that strongly suggest a more specific
              occurrence of purposeful maize feeding. Evidence is provided from
              ethnohistory and Maya mythology that may explain their distinctive
              mortuary and feeding behaviour. We infer that all of the deer in
              the Preclassic period contexts at Colha were wild and procured by
              hunting because they consumed a herbivorous C3diet.",

              relationship at the pre-Hispanic (AD 1–550) city of Teotihuacan in
              the Basin of Mexico and tests the hypothesis that leporids were
              managed or bred for food and secondary products within the urban
              core. We use stable isotope analysis (δ13Capatite and δ18Oapatite)
              of 134 leporid specimens from five archaeological contexts within
              the city and 13 modern specimens from across central Mexico to
              quantify aspects of leporid diet and ecology. The results
              demonstrate that leporids from Oztoyahualco, a residential complex
              associated with a unique rabbit sculpture and archaeological
              traces of animal butchering, exhibit the highest δ13Capatite
              values of the sample. These results imply greater consumption of
              human-cultivated foods, such as maize (Zea mays), by cottontails
              and jackrabbits at this complex and suggest practices of human
              provisioning. A lack of significant differences in δ18Oapatite
              values between ancient and modern leporids and between
              Oztoyahualco and other locations within Teotihuacan indicates
              generally similar relative humidity from sampled contexts. Results
              of this study support the notion that residents provisioned,
              managed, or bred leporids during the height of the city, and
              provide new evidence for mammalian animal husbandry in the ancient

              diagenesis necessitates careful sample preparation. The most
              common preparation method involves dilute acetic acid treatments
              to remove highly soluble mineral contaminants. However, there is
              variation in both treatment time and acid concentration. This

              δ18O, sample loss in solution, and sample Fourier transform
              infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characteristics. Samples of fresh and

              Carbonate δ13C and δ18O, sample loss and FTIR characteristics were
              measured at treatment times of 4 to 24 h. The results suggest that
              4 h of treatment suffice to remove highly soluble contaminants,
              and that longer treatment times can lead to sample
              recrystallization. Some samples treated with 1.0 M acid showed
              unacceptable loss or possible recrystallization, suggesting that
              0.1 M acid treatment is preferable. However, the more dilute acid
              caused smaller shifts in δ13C and δ18O for all samples and

              superior sample quality, it may not produce results directly

              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426–822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations

              concentrations and C:N ratios are relatively constant over a wide

              isotopic analysis of faunal remains. Stable carbon- and
              nitrogen-isotope compositions of bone collagen have been analysed
              for 24 dogs and 16 deer found in well-dated contexts from the
              prehistoric Maya lithic manufacturing community of Colha, Belize.
              The sample spans the Early Middle Preclassic period beginning
              1000–600 bc to the Terminal Late Preclassic period ending around
              ad 250. The majority of both dogs and deer come from middens, but
              three dogs come from cache contexts in buildings. The degree to
              which humans controlled the diets of these animals varies markedly
              by context and time period. The diets of midden dogs demonstrate a
              significant increase in the amount of C4(maize-based) foods and
              become more herbivorous over time. Because the midden dogs were
              probably dependent scavengers, this phenomenon might reflect the
              dynamics of human dietary change as the population at Colha
              expanded towards the end of the Preclassic period. An increase in
              the homogeneity of dog diets might also be indicative of either
              more restrictive human control over the animals or a reduction in
              the variability of resources used by humans. Alternatively,
              because the structure associated with the midden in which the dogs
              were found became more ceremonial in Late Preclassic times, the
              dogs from this period could be reflecting a general increase in
              purposeful feeding for ceremonial purposes. Dogs found in special
              (i.e. non-midden) contexts from both the Late Middle Preclassic
              and Late Late to Terminal Late Preclassic periods have distinctive
              isotopic signatures that strongly suggest a more specific
              occurrence of purposeful maize feeding. Evidence is provided from
              ethnohistory and Maya mythology that may explain their distinctive
              mortuary and feeding behaviour. We infer that all of the deer in
              the Preclassic period contexts at Colha were wild and procured by
              hunting because they consumed a herbivorous C3diet.",

              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma’s zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological
              evidence for this practice in Mesoamerica. It also represents the
              first systematic isotopic exploration of a population of
              archaeological eagles (n = 24) and felids (n = 29).",
