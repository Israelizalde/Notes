              there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild
              animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates
              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426-822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations
              within these felid populations further substantiates the
              postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated
              throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed
              from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have
              been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or
              delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and
              display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were
              routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to
              be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in
              order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes.",

              (87Sr/86Sr) for identifying migration within Lapita populations
              and their commensal animals, specifically the pig (Sus scrofa).
              Lapita people (ca. 3300–2200BP) were the initial colonists of the
              island groups to the east of the Solomon Islands, spreading from
              Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa within a few centuries.
              Mobility is assumed to have been an important mechanism for
              maintaining cultural solidarity between Lapita communities. It has
              been previously argued that Lapita populations became
              progressively more sedentary over time after the initial
              colonising events. Two Lapita sites, Kamgot and Balbalankin, from
              the Anir Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago are included in the
              analysis and fall within the Early (ca. 3300–3000/2900BP) and
              Middle (ca. 3000/2900–2700BP) Lapita periods respectively. Ten
              tooth enamel samples from Lapita human and pig teeth as well as
              modern teeth were analysed for strontium isotopes. The mean values
              for the individuals from both sites were higher than the
              geological value obtained for the Anir Islands reflecting the
              incorporation of marine-derived strontium into their tooth enamel
              taken up in their diet. Although the sample sites have similar
              environments there was a difference between the local ranges of
              the strontium isotopic data. One Lapita age pig and one
              potentially modern pig from Kamgot fell well outside the local
              distribution for the site and were considered to be non-local. The
              extreme distribution of the two outliers suggests they came from
              two geographically separate locations. The results from the Anir
              Islands when compared with strontium results from other
              prehistoric Pacific Island populations suggest there is sufficient
              variation between island groups in terms of the biologically
              available strontium to justify further research. The present
              results are discussed in terms of using pigs as a proxy for human
              mobility as well as an indicator for the ‘local’ range of an
              archaeological population by treating human and pigs as separate
              populations. Strontium isotopes therefore provide the opportunity
              to investigate migration in Lapita populations on a finer scale
              than was previously possible.",

              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1-550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma's zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological
              evidence for this practice in Mesoamerica. It also represents the

              not extend south of central Mexico, making the species non-local

  abstract  = "The turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) represents one of the few
               domestic animals of the New World. While current research points
               to distinct domestication centres in the Southwest USA and
               Mesoamerica, several questions regarding the number of progenitor
               populations, and the timing and intensity of turkey husbandry
               remain unanswered. This study applied ancient mitochondrial DNA
               and stable isotope (δ13C,δ15N) analysis to 55 archaeological
               turkey remains from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey
               exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different (sub)species of
               turkeys were identified in the archaeological record (M. g.
               mexicana,M. g. gallopavoandM. ocellata), indicating the
               exploitation of diverse local populations, as well as the trade
               of captively reared birds into the Maya area. No evidence of
               shared maternal haplotypes was observed between Mesoamerica and
               the Southwest USA, in contrast with archaeological evidence for
               trade of other domestic products. Isotopic analysis indicates a
               range of feeding behaviours in ancient Mesoamerican turkeys,
               including wild foraging, human provisioning and mixed feeding
               ecologies. This variability in turkey diet decreases through
               time, with archaeological, genetic and isotopic evidence all
               pointing to the intensification of domestic turkey management and
               husbandry, culminating in the Postclassic period.",
