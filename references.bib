              relationship at the pre-Hispanic (AD 1–550) city of Teotihuacan in
              the Basin of Mexico and tests the hypothesis that leporids were
              managed or bred for food and secondary products within the urban
              core. We use stable isotope analysis (δ13Capatite and δ18Oapatite)
              of 134 leporid specimens from five archaeological contexts within
              the city and 13 modern specimens from across central Mexico to
              quantify aspects of leporid diet and ecology. The results
              demonstrate that leporids from Oztoyahualco, a residential complex
              associated with a unique rabbit sculpture and archaeological
              traces of animal butchering, exhibit the highest δ13Capatite

              diagenesis necessitates careful sample preparation. The most
              common preparation method involves dilute acetic acid treatments
              to remove highly soluble mineral contaminants. However, there is
              variation in both treatment time and acid concentration. This

              δ18O, sample loss in solution, and sample Fourier transform
              infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characteristics. Samples of fresh and
              archaeological bone were treated with 1.0 M and 0.1 M acetic acid.
              Carbonate δ13C and δ18O, sample loss and FTIR characteristics were
              measured at treatment times of 4 to 24 h. The results suggest that
              4 h of treatment suffice to remove highly soluble contaminants,
              and that longer treatment times can lead to sample
              recrystallization. Some samples treated with 1.0 M acid showed
              unacceptable loss or possible recrystallization, suggesting that
              0.1 M acid treatment is preferable. However, the more dilute acid
              caused smaller shifts in δ13C and δ18O for all samples and
              treatment times. Thus, while 0.1 M acid appears to produce
              superior sample quality, it may not produce results directly
              comparable to those of 1.0 M acid treatments. This has important

              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426–822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations

              concentrations and C:N ratios are relatively constant over a wide
              range of collagen concentrations. However, prehistoric specimens

              be dependence on humans for food, a trait that we test through
              isotopic analysis of faunal remains. Stable carbon- and
              nitrogen-isotope compositions of bone collagen have been analysed
              for 24 dogs and 16 deer found in well-dated contexts from the
              prehistoric Maya lithic manufacturing community of Colha, Belize.
              The sample spans the Early Middle Preclassic period beginning
              1000–600 bc to the Terminal Late Preclassic period ending around
              ad 250. The majority of both dogs and deer come from middens, but
              three dogs come from cache contexts in buildings. The degree to
              which humans controlled the diets of these animals varies markedly
              by context and time period. The diets of midden dogs demonstrate a
              significant increase in the amount of C4(maize-based) foods and
              become more herbivorous over time. Because the midden dogs were
              probably dependent scavengers, this phenomenon might reflect the
              dynamics of human dietary change as the population at Colha
              expanded towards the end of the Preclassic period. An increase in
              the homogeneity of dog diets might also be indicative of either
              more restrictive human control over the animals or a reduction in
              the variability of resources used by humans. Alternatively,
              because the structure associated with the midden in which the dogs
              were found became more ceremonial in Late Preclassic times, the
              dogs from this period could be reflecting a general increase in
              purposeful feeding for ceremonial purposes. Dogs found in special
              (i.e. non-midden) contexts from both the Late Middle Preclassic
              and Late Late to Terminal Late Preclassic periods have distinctive
              isotopic signatures that strongly suggest a more specific
              occurrence of purposeful maize feeding. Evidence is provided from
              ethnohistory and Maya mythology that may explain their distinctive
              mortuary and feeding behaviour. We infer that all of the deer in
              the Preclassic period contexts at Colha were wild and procured by
              hunting because they consumed a herbivorous C3diet.",

  abstract = "From Roman gladiatorial combat to Egyptian animal mummies, the
              capture and manipulation of carnivores was instrumental in helping
              to shape social hierarchies throughout the ancient world. This
              paper investigates the historical inflection point when humans
              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1–550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma’s zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological
              evidence for this practice in Mesoamerica. It also represents the
              first systematic isotopic exploration of a population of
              archaeological eagles (n = 24) and felids (n = 29).",
