              capture and manipulation of carnivores was instrumental in helping
              to shape social hierarchies throughout the ancient world. This
              paper investigates the historical inflection point when humans
              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1-550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma's zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological
              evidence for this practice in Mesoamerica. It also represents the
              first systematic isotopic exploration of a population of
              archaeological eagles (n = 24) and felids (n = 29).",

              analysis (87Sr/86Sr) to study ancient Maya animal exchange.
              Traditional zooarchaeological methods of studying trade rely on
              the identification of animals found outside their natural
              geographic or habitat ranges. Isotopic analysis provides an
              additional means of identifying and sourcing non-local animals.
              87Sr/86Sr values from Maya zooarchaeological remains indicate that
              regional and long-distance transport and exchange of animal goods
              was more common than previously recognized. Widely distributed
              animals including deer and peccary were among the animals
              exchanged, which questions their common interpretation as
              locally-acquired resources. The isotopic results contribute to our
              understanding of how animal products were integrated into Maya
              economic and exchange networks. The research is also relevant to

              From the time of earliest habitation, this environment provided a

              documented at the cave site of Guila Naquitz. Light stable

              plants from Oaxaca that demonstrates 1) overlapping δ13C values of
              C4 plants, including maize, and plants that utilize the
              Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) pathway for biosynthesis, 2)

               populations, and the timing and intensity of turkey husbandry
               remain unanswered. This study applied ancient mitochondrial DNA
               and stable isotope (δ13C,δ15N) analysis to 55 archaeological
               turkey remains from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey
               exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different (sub)species of
               turkeys were identified in the archaeological record (M. g.
               mexicana,M. g. gallopavoandM. ocellata), indicating the
