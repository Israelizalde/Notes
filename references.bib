               research prospects that these technologies make possible are
               exciting, but they raise the issue of how comparable the original
               datasets really are. In this study we demonstrate an issue
               associated with many archaeological datasets: interanalyst
               variation. We conduct two independent analyses of one
               zooarchaeological assemblage and compare data. We consider the
               implications of the challenge interanalyst variation poses within
               projects and across projects. We then make recommendations for
               zooarchaeologists specifically, and for archaeologists more
               broadly, who are interested in publishing primary datasets in
               order to improve future understanding of these data and
               facilitate their reuse. These recommendations include specific
               guidance of what information needs to be published along with
               primary datasets to facilitate their responsible reuse in other
               projects, recommendations for incorporating interanalyst

               explore such relationships, particularly in the pre-colonial
               Americas where many domesticated crops utilize the C4
               photosynthetic pathway and display divergent stable carbon
               isotope values relative to wild C3 plants. By studying biological
               tissues of animals and humans, the amount of C4 foods in the diet
               may be used as a natural tracer and questions involving
               human-animal interactions may be addressed. This chapter (1)
               provides an in-depth overview of carbon stable isotope analysis

              using bone collagen stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis.
              The objective was to identify the dietary patterns of an Aztec
              community living in the Basin of Mexico. The collection analyzed
              includes adult and subadult skeletons from the residential site of
              San Cristóbal Ecatepec (in present-day Mexico State) (A.D.
              900–1521). The isotopic data were compared with available
              ethnohistoric and archeological information about Aztec diets. We
              conclude that Ecatepec residents consumed mostly C4 and CAM plants
              (as opposed to C3 plants), terrestrial animals, and some
              lacustrine resources. They shared similar diets and foodways, as
              indicated by the fact that they belonged to the same
              socio-economic group and that there were no substantial sex-based
              differences indicated by the isotopic data. The slightly higher
              carbon isotope compositions of the men compared with the women
              could be evidence of pulque consumption by the men—as noted in the
              ethnohistoric record. The nitrogen isotope compositions of the
              subadults, however, show some variability related to breastfeeding
              and weaning practices, with infants weaning between 2 and 4 years
              of age.",

               suggest that local people ate relatively more maize than observed
               at many other comparable Maya sites, and hint that dietary
               practices at Pusilha may have been related to sex and status.
               Furthermore, strontium and oxygen isotope data imply that four
               individuals were born and spent their early childhood outside of
               the eastern Maya lowlands. One individual may have come from the
               northern Maya lowlands, a second from the volcanic highlands of
               Guatemala, and two more from the Copan region. In three cases,

              contexts are based on units derived, in one way or another, from
              the number of identified specimens (NISP): the minimum number of
              elements (MNE), the minimal animal unit (MAU), and the
              skeletal-element based minimum number of individuals (MNI). MNE
              values can be interpreted as if they were the results of a
              sampling exercise, telling us the chances that specimens drawn
              from a population of NISP values match in some specified way.
              Since this is the case, MNE values should scale to the NISPs for
              the body part involved. Since MAUs are generally calculated by
              standardizing MNE values by the number of times the part occurs in
              the skeleton, and MNIs by a combination of this and both age- and
              side-matching, there should be a very predictable relationship
              between the values of NISP, MNE, MAU, and MNI within any given
              assemblage. Using a series of assemblages from South Africa, Iran,
              and France, we show that this is, in fact, the case.",

              effectively examine tool manufacture and use of various
              archaeological material elements. This methodology is based on the
              macroscopic and microscopic analyses of traces generated on the
              surface of an object during its manufacture and/or use. These
              analyses, as well as inference, are used through analytical
              experiments to empirically and systematically reconstruct how the
              objects were made and/or used. The application of functional
              analysis on non-lithic materials (mainly bone or shell) has been
              quite rare. This is because these objects have usually only been
              analyzed from a morpho-typological perspective. Thus, traceology
              analysis has been underutilized in the functional study of
              materials with physical, chemical and preservation characteristics
              that are more heterogeneous than stone artifacts. However, it is a
              methodology with great potential for extracting information about
              the manufacture and use of shell objects. It will also help to
              focus the interest not on morphology, but on the manufacturing
              process and use of shell tools and/or ornaments as a means of
              studying past societies.",

  pages    = "227--259",
  abstract = "Jack Harlan was a polymath. His life-long study of crop evolution
              combined plant sciences, archaeology, systematics, genetics, and
              conservation, leaving a legacy of five decades of influential
              publications that explored all aspects of crop plants – their
              origins, their dispersal, and their continued and future role in
              supporting the Earth's burgeoning populations. To Harlan,
              agriculture was not an invention or the product of a single big
              idea. Instead, he saw agricultural origins in terms of a long
              co-evolutionary process involving humans and plants that grew out
              of “many independent tentatives in many locations that fused over
              time to produce effective food production systems” (Harlan 1995).
              Harlan's remarkable body of published work contains only one short
              encyclopedia entry on the subject of animal domestication (Harlan
              1994). He was, in fact, somewhat dismissive of the contribution of
              animal domesticates to humankind's food supply stating that
              “(a)nimals are not essential, plants supply over 90\% of the food
              consumed by humans” (Harlan 1995). Jack Harlan would likely agree,
              however, that understanding livestock evolution requires the same
              breadth of focus that he brought to the study of crop evolution.
              Here I follow Harlan's example in a consideration of domestic
              animals, bringing together information from animal sciences,
              genetics, and archaeology to explore the multiple pathways leading
              to animal domestication and the implications of these pathways for
              current and future relationships between humans and their animal
              partners. Domestication as a process All considerations of
              domestication, whether focusing on crops or livestock, acknowledge
              that it involves a two-way relationship between humans and target
              plant or animal populations. There is less unanimity in different
              conceptual approaches to domestication on whether emphasis should
              be placed on the human or the plant/animal side of the equation
              (see Zeder 2006a). Some cast humans as the dominant partner in a
              relationship in which humans consciously and with deliberate
              intent assume “mastery” over all aspects of the production,
              movement, feeding, and protection of the domesticate (Hale 1969,
              Ducos 1978, Bökönyi 1989, Clutton-Brock 1994). Others see
              domestication as a form of biological mutualism in which both
              partners (humans and domesticate) reap benefits (O'Connor 1997).
              Some even contend that domesticates manipulated unwitting humans
              into relationships that gave the domesticate great evolutionary
              advantage at the expense of human fitness (Rindos 1984, Budiansky
              1992, Morey 1994).",

              Tenochtitlan son producciones locales y no piezas foráneas,
              obtenidas por tributo, intercambio o saqueo. En el caso de los
              objetos de concha y lapidaria, sus características formales
              permiten identificar a un importante grupo no solamente como
              propio del centro de México, sino como exclusivo de Tenochtitlan e
              incluso de su templo principal, ya que elementos idénticos no han
              sido recuperados en otros emplazamientos o en las edificaciones
              aledañas al Huey Teocalli tenochca. El estudio de las técnicas de
              manufactura de estas piezas ha permitido confirmar esta suposición
              e incluso proponer la existencia de un estilo tecnológico
              tenochca. La gran estandarización morfológica y tecnológica de los
              objetos y su restringida distribución, permiten proponer que su
              producción se llevaba a cabo en un contexto dependiente,

               en la biología, sin embargo, existen casos en los que no se ha
               interpretado adecuadamente. Se considera que utilizar un término
               unificado de especie puede ayudar a clarificar el concepto de
               área de distribución, pues se incorpora la idea de dimensión
               espacial al señalar que las especies son linajes
               metapoblacionales que evolucionan separadamente. El área de
               distribución se define como la fracción del espacio geográfico
               donde una especie está presente e interactúa de manera no efímera
               con el ecosistema. La presencia o ausencia de éstas en el espacio
               geográfico está definida por factores biogeográficos,
               fisiológicos, así como ecológicos. A pesar de ser un atributo
               difícil de estimar, se han descrito algunos patrones referentes a

               Maxent software for modeling species distributions from
               occurrence records and environmental data, and describes a new R
               package for fitting such models. The new release (ver. 3.4.0)
               will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History,
               along with future versions. It contains small functional changes,
               most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform
               to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog
               transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of
               Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a
               stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform
               which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package,
               maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for
               regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the
               implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and
               outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid
               cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output)
               as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two
               open-source developments, we invite others to freely use and
               contribute to the software.",

              meaning that non-parametric approaches may be better suited for
              addressing hypotheses. An important consideration is that
              archaeologists do not directly or randomly sample target

              sampling error is not randomly generated. Thus, use of inferential
              statistics is potentially suspect. A solution to this problem is
              to rely on a weight of evidence research strategy and to limit
              analysis to descriptive statistics. Alternatively, if one chooses
              to use statistical inference, one should analyse effect size to
              determine practical significance of results and adopt
              conservative, robust inferential tests that require relatively few
              assumptions. Archaeologists may choose not to abandon statistical

               Guatemala, that illuminate the role that migration played in the
               history of the state. Stable strontium isotope ratios of human
               teeth parallel the bedrock geology of the location where foods
               were grown, while stable oxygen isotope ratios reflect the
               sources of water imbibed, and track geographic variation in the
               isotopic composition of rain water. Because tooth enamel forms
               during childhood and is not remodeled during life, we can
               identify foreign-born individuals at Tikal by their outlying
               strontium and oxygen isotope ratios. These data indicate that
               approximately 11–16\% of the sampled Tikal skeletons spent their
               childhood at distant sites. Most of the migrant burials date from
               the Early Classic period and are high status contexts. Several
               royal burials demonstrate long distance movement of both males
               and females, and shed light on the identification of
               epigraphically-known individuals. Yet, both Early and Late
               Classic migrants are found in lower status domestic burials.
               Interaction with distant peers was important in the rise of the
               Tikal polity, however, immigration from all social tiers

              relations among modalities and intensities at which human activity
              influences the local flora and fauna. The concomitant fluctuations
              in cultural control over the ecosystem, duly reflected in the

              in this study of isotope variations representing the entire range

              remains from archaeological sites around Parita Bay in central
              Pacific Panama. Human feeding of captive bird species (e.g.,
              ducks, guan, and parrots) and animal raiding of milpa plots are
              two good examples of the mutualistic co-habitation of humans and
              animals. This study utilizes the C4 input into an animal’s diet as
              a proxy, which, in tandem with inputs from paleobotany and
              zooarchaeology, greatly improve knowledge about human and animal

               contrasting status groups at Altun Ha, Belize. The sample spans
               the Preclassic to Postclassic periods, approximately 800 B. C. to
               after A. D. 950. Although Altun Ha has a maize-based (C-4) diet,
               it has a much stronger marine/reef component than any other Maya
               site studied so far. Two possible dedicatory burial groups are
               dietarily distinct. The source of protein appears to have been
               fairly stable throughout the site sequence, but a marked shift to
               reduced consumption of C4 foods seems to have occurred after the
               Early Classic period. A second similar decline probably occurred
               between the Late/Terminal Classic and the Postclassic periods.
               These apparent temporal trends may, however, be confounded by
               differences between zones. High status is marked by consumption
               of large quantities of C4 foods, possibly including C4-fed
               terrestrial animals. Males consumed more meat and C4 foods than

               Histological results from a 16th-century Iroquoian dog which had
               previously been diagnosed by macroscopic and molecular methods
               with tuberculosis-induced hypertrophic osteopathy (HPO) are

               skeletal manifestations of HPO are reminiscent of human
               alterations caused by this condition. In addition, the microscopy
               reveals an aggressive form of HPO that was chronic in nature

              paper investigates the historical inflection point when humans
              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1-550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma's zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological

              rule. This paper uses the relationship among countries as the

              social network analysis, where the goal is to demonstrate their
              applicability to the study of international trade of forest
              products. Compared to statistical analysis, additional benefit of
              social network analysis is the fact that the assumption of
              independence of observations does not hold true; and thus enables
              a more thorough insight into the structure of the international
              trade network. Data on international trade of chemical wood pulp,
              truffles, and aggregate forest products in the 1988–2006 period is
              used to demonstrate the applicability of selected network indices

              covers topics of network visualization, characteristics of the

              modelling of international trade that includes endogenous effects

              certification and contribution of forestry to the gross domestic

              interpretation. Prominent topics of application are the structural

              are based on the carbon and oxygen stable isotope (δ13Cenamel and
              δ18Oenamel) composition of herbivore tooth enamel from these
              sites. Although tooth enamel is subject to diagenetic processes,
              it is generally assumed to be a refractory substrate that retains
              the in vivo isotopic signal during fossilization. However, the
              effects of burning, for which there is extensive evidence, on the
              isotopic composition of herbivore tooth enamel is often
              overlooked. Here, the consequences of burning on δ13Cenamel and
              δ18Oenamel values of five African herbivore taxa are directly
              tested in a series of controlled combustion experiments up to 1100
              °C. Results suggest that δ13Cenamel values are minimally affected
              by burning up to 700 °C for all taxa, and up to 1100 °C for all
              but the thin-enameled Madoqua (dik-dik). δ18Oenamel values, on the
              other hand, are significantly altered at temperatures beyond 300
              °C for all taxa, with enamel becoming increasingly and
              systematically 18O depleted at higher temperatures. This is
              suggestive of a temperature-dependent biochemical process of
              exchange with atmospheric oxygen. These results suggest that while
              δ13Cenamel values from burned teeth are potentially reliable for
              typical hearth temperatures, strong caution is needed when
              interpreting δ18Oenamel values from context with evidence of

               decedent American populations in hopes that it will applicable to
               the field of Forensic Anthropology. Forty-five individuals from
               the C.A. Pound Human Identification Lab and the Wichita State
               Biological Anthropology Lab with full mandibular dentition were
               studied. The mesio-distal width of both right and left canines
               and the canine arch width were taken and the MCI calculated along
               with the standard MCI. Results show that the MCI is not
               statistically significant in determining males from females
               (p=.461 for right and p=.473 for left). The standard MCI was .242
               for the right and .246 for the left. This gave an accuracy of
               37\% to 44\% for males and 44\% to 45\% for females. The
               mesio-distal length (p = .002 for right and .001 for left) and
               canine arch width (p=.019) on their own were statistically
               significant and can be used in sex assessment if the teeth are
               present although they should be used with other methods. Further
               study should be done with a larger sample size to see if results

               determinations on remains from four individuals recovered from
               burials dated to 595-950 CE. The possible impact of diagenesis,
               in this context probably related to the use of modern
               fertilizers, on the results is also evaluated. The combination of
               Sr, C and N isotope results show that the individuals examined
               here were likely local people who were consuming maize-based
               terrestrial food. The discrepancy observed between the strontium
               isotopic composition of these four individuals and the local
               strontium signature is best explained by a contribution from sea
               salt as well as the alkali solution used in the nixtamalization
               process. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The use of expanded criteria donors (ECDs) is still
              limited because of inferior graft survival compared to standard
              criteria donors (SCDs). We assessed the impact of immediate graft
              function (IGF) on renal graft survival among recipients of SCD and
              ECD grafts to determine whether these kidneys performed equally
              well under ``ideal'' conditions favoring IGF. METHODS: We included
              all cadaveric renal transplants performed from 1990 to 2002 (n =
              335). Delayed graft function (DGF) was defined as the need for
              dialysis in the first 7 days posttransplant. Slow graft function
              (SGF) and IGF were defined as a serum creatinine fall by 20\% in
              the first 24 hours posttransplant, respectively. Non-death
              censored actual graft survivals are reported herein. RESULTS:
              Seventy-two of the 335 subjects (21.5\%) received organs from ECDs
              and displayed IGF in 54.7\%, SGF 16.2\%, and DGF 29.1\%. Among
              SCDs, the SGF and DGF rates were 15.3\% and 23.4\%, respectively.
              In ECD, the SGF and DGF rates were 19.4\% and 50\% (P < .02).
              Actual graft survivals at 1 and 5 years was 86.3\% and 70.4\%,
              respectively. Patients with IGF had higher actual graft survival
              at 5 years compared to SGF and DGF (83.5\% vs 74.1\% vs 45.4\%).
              DGF had an equally bad impact on actual 5-year graft survival in
              SCDs and ECDs (42.6\% vs 50\%). CONCLUSION: DGF has a strong
              detrimental impact on 5-year graft survival. There is a higher
              rate of DGF in ECD versus SCD kidneys. The detrimental impact on
              5-year actual graft survival is equal in SCD and ECD kidneys.
              Minimizing DGF should be our goal.",

               analysis of NGW grains with updated results from a parallel study
               of chaff dehiscence, to assess the taxonomic classification and

               timopheevii, in a form which has remained remarkably similar over
               thousands of years. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that NGW
               was undergoing selection for domestication traits in terms of
               shattering behaviour and grain form during the 1150-year East
               Mound sequence. These findings are interpreted in the context of
               substantial archaeobotanical evidence for a broad-spectrum plant

               failure and supported experimentation in cropping. Possible

               fully-domesticated glume wheat (emmer) with similar growing and

              limits, including major ceremonial precincts, large pyramids and
              temples, residential areas, exchange sectors, thousands of
              residential compounds, and tunnels under the northern half of the
              city. Some of these residential compounds contain non-local
              architecture, artefacts, and burial arrangements known from areas
              on the Gulf Coast and in Oaxaca. The identity of the residents of
              these “foreign” compounds is uncertain. Were these local
              individuals adopting foreign customs, recent immigrants to the
              city, or a mix of locals and outsiders? After the fall of
              Teotihuacan, people with Coyotlatelco culture came to the city and
              contributed to its extensive looting. Some scholars have proposed
              a northern or western origin for these groups. We have measured
              the strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) in human bone and tooth
              enamel from individuals buried in various areas of the city for
              information on their original place of birth. Strontium isotope
              ratios are signatures for local geologies. Strontium in human bone
              and tooth enamel comes from the food growing in local geologies.
              Strontium isotope ratios in human bone reflect the source of a
              diet around the time of death; ratios in tooth enamel reflect the
              source of the diet around the time of birth. Differences between
              enamel and bone ratios in the same individual indicate differences
              in local geologies and thus a change in residence. Our study
              indicates that a number of the individuals were born outside the
              city. Comparison with other isotopic methods for assessing
              residential change is also made.",

              basin. Detrital quartz shows a large range in δ18O (from 5 to 25‰)
              which overlaps the analyses of authigenic cements (20–34‰).
              Combining these data with the burial history and precipitation
              sequence of minerals indicates that meteoric water may have
              precipitated quartz at temperatures between 15 and 35°C over a
              period of 180 MA (300-120Ma). This nearly isothermal precipitation

              be dependence on humans for food, a trait that we test through
              isotopic analysis of faunal remains. Stable carbon- and
              nitrogen-isotope compositions of bone collagen have been analysed
              for 24 dogs and 16 deer found in well-dated contexts from the
              prehistoric Maya lithic manufacturing community of Colha, Belize.
              The sample spans the Early Middle Preclassic period beginning
              1000–600 bc to the Terminal Late Preclassic period ending around
              ad 250. The majority of both dogs and deer come from middens, but
              three dogs come from cache contexts in buildings. The degree to
              which humans controlled the diets of these animals varies markedly
              by context and time period. The diets of midden dogs demonstrate a
              significant increase in the amount of C4(maize-based) foods and
              become more herbivorous over time. Because the midden dogs were
              probably dependent scavengers, this phenomenon might reflect the
              dynamics of human dietary change as the population at Colha
              expanded towards the end of the Preclassic period. An increase in
              the homogeneity of dog diets might also be indicative of either
              more restrictive human control over the animals or a reduction in
              the variability of resources used by humans. Alternatively,
              because the structure associated with the midden in which the dogs
              were found became more ceremonial in Late Preclassic times, the
              dogs from this period could be reflecting a general increase in
              purposeful feeding for ceremonial purposes. Dogs found in special
              (i.e. non-midden) contexts from both the Late Middle Preclassic
              and Late Late to Terminal Late Preclassic periods have distinctive
              isotopic signatures that strongly suggest a more specific
              occurrence of purposeful maize feeding. Evidence is provided from
              ethnohistory and Maya mythology that may explain their distinctive
              mortuary and feeding behaviour. We infer that all of the deer in
              the Preclassic period contexts at Colha were wild and procured by
              hunting because they consumed a herbivorous C3diet.",

              energy expenditure, and milk intake often assume that there is no
              recycling of isotopes once they have left the labeled animal. In
              experiments involving lactating females or their suckling
              offspring, there are several possible routes of isotope recycling.
              These include the consumption of labeled milk by offspring, the
              ingestion of labeled excreta, and the rebreathing of exhaled
              labeled CO(2) or water vapor by both mother and offspring. Isotope
              recycling might be especially important during lactation because
              the offspring are in close contact with each other and their
              mother for prolonged periods. We show here in 24- to 30-day-old
              domestic dog Canis familiaris puppies that there was no detectable
              transfer of (18)O or (2)H from labeled to unlabeled pups in two
              litters (16 pups, 8 labeled, 8 unlabeled) that were weaned early
              and independent of their mother. However, there was a significant
              transfer of both isotopes from labeled to unlabeled pups and from
              labeled pups to their mothers in nine equivalent nursing litters
              of the same age (27 labeled, 26 unlabeled pups). The increases in
              enrichment of isotopes in unlabeled offspring were greater than
              the increases in enrichment of the mothers. This indicates that
              maternal ingestion of offspring excreta and subsequent transfer of
              isotope in milk is not the sole pathway of recycling. Additional
              routes must also be important, such as exchange of isotope between
              pups on saliva-coated nipples and perhaps direct ingestion of
              excreta by unweaned young. Recycling is unlikely to be an
              important factor when determining maternal metabolic rate during
              peak lactation in domestic dogs. However, experiments that are
              designed to assess the energy demands of pups and isotope-based
              estimates of water turnover in offspring may need to take into
              account any effects of isotope recycling. In a theoretical
              example, removing the effects of recycling increased the measured
              energy expenditure in pups by up to 7\% and increased the
              calculated elimination rates of both isotopes by up to 11.1\% in
              (18)oxygen and 10.9\% in (2)hydrogen.",

              ‘Brown Sand’ (BS) and ‘White Ash’ (WA) members. Geoarchaeological
              work in the 1970s focused on stratigraphic sequencing of the
              anthropogenic assemblages, and proposed broad correlations between
              autogenic contributions and environmental conditions. The research
              presented here was undertaken as part of a new excavation campaign
              at Border Cave started in 2015 under the direction of Backwell at
              al. Re-examining the stratigraphic context of the deposits and
              assessing site formation processes are among the key goals of this
              project; this will enable finer-scale intra- and inter-member
              comparative analyses of the artefacts and ecofacts recovered at
              the site. In this paper, we apply a facies and allostratigraphic
              approach to assess the stratigraphic sequence exposed through the
              Backwell et al. excavations. We also provide an initial assessment
              of the prevailing site formation processes active in the
              deposition and modification of the sediments. The
              geoarchaeological data are integrated with new zooarchaeological
              and taphonomic evidence in order to explore inter- and intra-unit
              patterns throughout the sequence. Results of this work are: (1)
              exposed sediments can be broadly correlated to members of the
              Beaumont sequence; (2) we clearly define member boundaries,
              reassess member stratigraphic complexity and recognise finer
              intra-member layering; (3) geoarchaeological and taphonomic
              studies demonstrate that the sediments have been subjected to
              greater post-depositional disturbance than was previously
              recognised and affect all levels of the sequence; (4) overall,
              faunal density at BC appears to be much lower than that at other
              Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos and Sibudu; (5) multiproxy
              analysis suggests that WA and BS members have distinctive
              taphonomic histories that cross-cut the identified archaeological
              industries. As such, caution is warranted when combining BS and WA
              members for analysis of artefacts and ecofacts.",

               a huge contribution to understanding dietary change across the
               Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. One of the major findings is
               that marine resources were abandoned with the onset of farming in
               some coastal regions of Europe. This paper considers the isotopic
               evidence from terrestrial central Europe, asking whether there
               was a similar large-scale abandonment of freshwater resources in
               the early Neolithic. Using isotopic data from the published
               literature, stable isotope ratios from 66 Mesolithic burials are
               compared to 274 Neolithic individuals, from France, inland
               Belgium and Germany. The results are then modelled via FRUITS
               (Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals). The
               results suggest that despite a drop in fish consumption in the
               Neolithic, aquatic resources continued to form a small but
               significant part of the diet (est. 6\%). Changes in plant protein
               consumption are argued to account for a greater proportion of the
               difference between the Mesolithic and Neolithic δ 13 C and δ 15 N
               isotope ratios. It is concluded that plants should see greater
               attention from interpretative approaches in the early Neolithic
               of central Europe to further our understanding of diet both as a
               social practice and subsistence activity.",

              early human evolution. To facilitate this application we analyzed
              delta18OP values of modern human teeth collected at 12 sites
              located at latitudes ranging from 4 degrees N to 70 degrees N
              together with the corresponding oxygen composition of tap waters
              (delta18OW) from these areas. In addition, the delta18O of some
              raw and boiled foods were determined and simple mass balance
              calculations were performed to investigate the impact of solid
              food consumption on the oxygen isotope composition of the total
              ingested water (drinking water+solid food water). The results,
              along with those from three, smaller published data sets, can be
              considered as random estimates of a unique delta18OW/delta18OP

              delta18OW=1.54(+/-0.09)xdelta18OP-33.72(+/-1.51)(R2=0.87: p
              [H0:R2=0]=2x10(-19)). The delta18O of cooked food is higher than
              that of the drinking water. As a consequence, in a modern diet the
              delta18O of ingested water is +1.05 to 1.2 per thousand higher
              than that of drinking water in the area. In meat-dominated and
              cereal-free diets, which may have been the diets of some of our
              early ancestors, the shift is a little higher and the application
              of the regression equation would slightly overestimate delta18OW
              in these cases.",

              imperiales, usando evidencias arqueológicas y etnohistóricas de
              Mesoamérica. Por conve-niencia las llamamos «estrategias
              provinciales». Contrastando datos del Postclásico Tardío para el

              México, investigamos sus semejanzas y diferencias para plantear
              una comprensión más sistemática de las estrategias provinciales.
              Nuestro enfoque se apoya en la pre-misa de que no sólo los poderes
              imperiales tuvieron estrategias para la administración de sus
              poblaciones sujetas, sino que también los súbditos provinciales
              usaron varias estrategias para mantener y mejorar su posi-ción
              dentro del imperio. Identificamos y discutimos nueve estrategias
              provinciales vigentes en Mesoamérica y el modo en que fueron
              afectadas por la distancia geográfica y los factores ambientales,
              la duración del dominio imperial, las clases sociales y las
              diferencias en la integración económica y social de las

              relating to strategies employed by people in imperial provinces,
              using archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence from Mesoamerica.
              For convenience, we refer to these as provincial strategies. By
              contrasting Late Postclassic data for the Aztec empire and
              Colonial data for the Spanish empire in Mexico, we explore their
              commonalities and differences to advance a more systematic
              understanding of provincial strategies. Our approach rests on the
              premise that, just as imperial powers had strategies for
              administering their subjects, the provincial subjects also
              employed various strategies for protecting and improving their
              position within the empire. Nine provincial strategies operative
              in Mesoamerica were affected by geographic distance and
              environmental factors, duration of imperial rule, social class,
              and differences in the economic and social integration of subject
              populations. Sumario: 1. Conceptos referentes a las estrategias.

               sites. The Fremont were a diverse group of people who practiced
               hunting and horticulture from 500 to 1300 CE in what is now
               modern Utah. The transport of large game by Fremont hunters is
               examined at two sites: Five Finger Ridge in central Utah and Wolf
               Village in northern Utah. The results suggest that Fremont
               hunters obtained at least some large game individuals from areas
               away from their habitations, potentially through trade. The
               results of this study are regionally relevant for presenting
               previously unpublished results of strontium isotope analysis in
               Utah, a topic rarely explored. The research is also broadly
               relevant by showcasing potential complications with tracking
               prehistoric trade in locations with similar geology on a
               wide-scale, and dissimilar geology on a small-scale.",

               (phytoliths) deposited in grasses. The oxygen-isotope composition
               of phytolith silica is dependent on soil-water δ18O values,
               relative humidity and evapotranspiration, and temperature during
               plant growth. Phytolith and plant-water δ18O values for C3 (A.
               breviligulata) and C4 (C. longifolia) grasses from natural and
               greenhouse sites in southwestern Ontario were used to compare the
               isotopic fractionation between biogenic silica and water in
               various parts of these living plants. For non or weakly
               transpiring tissues (rhizomes, stems, sheaths) in both grass
               species, the Δ18Osilica-plant water remained constant at ∼34‰,
               and the δ18O and δD values of plant water collected from pre-dawn
               and mid-day samplings showed little variation. These plant waters
               were only slightly enriched in 18O and D relative to water
               provided to the grasses. Isotopic temperatures calculated from
               the silica and plant-water isotopic data matched measured growing
               temperatures for the region. By comparison, the upper leaf water
               was extremely enriched in oxygen-18 and deuterium at maximum
               rates of transpiration relative to water from non-transpiring
               tissues, as were the calculated, steady-state values for
               leaf-water δ18O and δD. Silica produced in the transpiring
               tissues (leaf, inflorescence) has higher δ18O values than silica
               from non-transpiring tissues, but the enrichment is modest
               compared to upper leaf water under mid-day conditions. Leaf
               phytoliths have formed from plant water typical of average
               conditions in the lower leaf, where the extreme 18O-enrichment is
               not encountered. C. longifolia was also collected from Alberta
               and Nebraska, where growing conditions are different from
               southwestern Ontario. Phytoliths at all three sites have a
               similar pattern of δ18O values within the plants, but the
               isotopic separation between leaf and stem silica increases from 4
               to 8‰ as average relative humidity decreases. The difference
               between actual growing temperature and that calculated using
               measured δ18O values for stem silica and local meteoric water
               became progressively larger as relative humidity decreased,
               likely because of evaporative 18O-enrichment of soil water. Such
               effects are most pronounced in arid environments and pertinent in
               grasslands where much of the active rooting zone can be situated
               at the shallower depths most affected by the 18O-enrichment of
               soil water.",

              México. The first is at the end of 18th century with the discovery
              of a Prehispanic offering with canid remains. Although a
              scientific tradition was not based on this discovery, a clear
              precedent was set for interest in the study of human–animal
              relationships. The second moment is at the end of the 19th
              century, when some Pleistocene localities in the Basin of México
              were discovered. The localities provide evidence of the early
              peopling in México and the early use of extinct animals,
              increasing the interest in Prehistoric issues and later in uses of
              fauna by former cultures. Those investigations were undertaken
              within the main scientific institutions of the country. The early
              works constitute a tradition that connects with the interest of
              two influential archaeologists, Manuel Gamio and José Luis
              Lorenzo. In the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia,
              José Luis Lorenzo promoted the creation of a specialized
              laboratory to study faunal remains and the relationships with
              human groups, in the middle of the 20th century. This sealed the
              traditional link between biologist and archaeologist, and
              archaeozoology was formalized as an interdisciplinary practice,

              sharing have focused on neontological and paleontological specimen
              records, making available over a billion records through the
              Global Biodiversity Information Facility. But to date, less effort
              has been placed on the integration of important archaeological
              sources of biodiversity, such as zooarchaeological specimens.
              Zooarchaeological specimens are rich with both biological and
              cultural heritage data documenting nearly all phases of human
              interaction with animals and the surrounding environment through

              neontological sources of data within biodiversity networks. Here
              we describe technical advances for mobilizing zooarchaeological
              specimen-specific biological and cultural data. In particular, we
              demonstrate adaptations in the workflow used by biodiversity
              publisher VertNet to mobilize Darwin Core formatted
              zooarchaeological data to the GBIF network. We also show how a
              linked open data approach can be used to connect existing
              biodiversity publishing mechanisms with archaeoinformatics
              publishing mechanisms through collaboration with the Open Context
              platform. Examples of ZooArchNet published datasets are used to
              show the efficacy of creating this critically needed bridge
              between biological and archaeological sources of open access data.
              These technical advances and efforts to support data publication
              are placed in the larger context of ZooarchNet, a new project

  abstract = "Unheated and heat-treated bovine bone material with differing
              heating times and heat-treated in increments from 100 °C to 1000
              °C were analysed to study the crystallographic change of fresh
              biological bone mineral occuring during incineration. We combine
              several complementary analytical methods applied to the same
              un-heated and heat treated material to ensure data consistency in
              order to establish a comprehensive study on heat-induced changes
              in bone. We applied quantitative powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier
              Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Infrared-coupled
              Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA-FTIR), and we correlated the
              analytical results with empirical indicators such as crystallinity
              indices (CI and IRSF) and bone colour changes after burning. At
              temperatures from 700 °C onwards after 30 min of heating, a
              considerable recrystallization reaction from bioapatite to
              hydroxyapatite occurred. FTIR revealed that there are no or only
              minor amounts of hydroxyl-ions in original bone mineral which in
              consequence should be referred to ``carbonate-hydro-apatite''
              rather than hydroxyapatite. Thermal treatment induced a pronounced
              increase of crystallite size and an increase of hydroxyl groups in
              the apatite lattice accompanied by a depletion of water and
              reduction of carbonate contents during incineration. Thus, the
              heat treatment at temperatures ≥700 °C leads to the
              recrystallization of bioapatite to hydroxyapatite. Above 800 °C
              buchwaldite is formed from the Na component within the bone
              mineral. Moreover, we found that the transformation reaction
              involving crystallite growth mainly sets in after organic matrix
              compounds and their residues have been combusted and the apatite
              grains get into direct contact. The information in this work,
              obtained by a combination of analytical methods which are
              typically applied and approved to determine bone cremation
              temperatures, can help to better understand changes in complex
              bio-materials during heating. In particular, the knowledge from
              this study can be applied to assess the cremation conditions of
              archaeological bone finds. As changes in the bone mineral state
              are not only dependent on temperature but also on time, care must
              be taken to deduce a defined temperature which cremated bone finds
              were exposed to.",

               relational in that it is the ties between actors (or nodes) that

               a diversity of theoretical approaches to networks, and the

               of current taphonomic studies. Available experimental analogies
               aim at differentiating agencies in the production of fractured
               bones. Possible equifinality presented by different agents can
               hinder the characterisation of bone breakage at archaeological
               sites. Equally important is the potential distortion that
               bone-breaking processes introduce in bone surface modification
               (BSM) frequencies. This study presents an experimental approach
               to the problem of identifying signatures for anthropogenic bone
               breaking as a product of direct hammerstone percussion. This
               study also contributes to improving the existing analogical
               framework on processes related to bone breakage of medium-sized
               animals (80–200 kg), since most previous experimentation has
               focused on smaller (10–80 kg) and larger (200–800 kg) carcasses.
               It has been possible to verify the existence of non-random and
               non-intentional breakage patterns on long bones due to their
               shape and structural properties. Thus, this introduces the
               possibility of correctly identifying anthropogenic fracture
               patterns in the archaeological record. Additionally, it also
               opens up the possibility of finding different cultural patterns.
               It has frequently been argued that the frequency of bone surface
               modifications correlates with fragmentation intensity. However,
               this assertion remained untested until now. Here, we test the
               frequency and occurrence of percussion and cut marks in faunal
               assemblages according to the intensity of green bone
               fragmentation. The results also improve the current referential

               dynamic loading.",

               domesticated mammal species (n = 19) from the Viking Haithabu and
               medieval Schleswig sites in Northern Germany and demonstrated
               that a generalized relationship between δ 18 O carbonate and δ 18
               O phosphate with a fixed value for oxygen isotope spacing (Δδ 18

               differ considerably from the commonly applied, fixed value of
               about 9 ‰ with values ranging from 3.8 to 8.1 ‰ (μ = 6.1 ‰ ± 0.9

               conclude that this variability does no longer permit an
               approximation of oxygen isotope values of bone phosphate from
               carbonate, because δ 18 O phosphate values approximated in such a

               the sojourning of children in other regions and the relocation of
               breastfeeding women. These segments of the population would have
               played major roles in the social and political articulation of

               that some immigrants died shortly after their arrival in

              from the Moon Pyramid at Teotihuacan and to reconstruct changes in
              residence since their childhoods, we analyzed tooth enamel for
              oxygen- and strontium-isotope ratios and bone just for
              oxygen-isotope ratios. The combination of these analytical
              techniques involves both climatic and geological variables,
              therefore enhancing resolution of geographic identification. Most
              of the sacrificed individuals appear to have been born in a
              foreign location. These regions probably include other areas
              within the Basin of Mexico and the central highlands, as well as
              the Gulf Coast and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Other possible
              regions of origin are the southern highlands, the Motagua Valley,
              and the Maya Lowlands. There is considerable overlap in the
              oxygen-isotope ratios between the Moon Pyramid and Feathered
              Serpent Pyramid victims, but each structure contains a group of
              isotopically distinct individuals. The Moon Pyramid sacrifices
              include some individuals with high oxygen-isotope ratios, possibly
              indicating the Gulf Coast or Maya Lowlands, whereas the Feathered
              Serpent Pyramid contains a distinct group with very low
              oxygen-isotope ratios, possibly indicating Oaxaca, Michoacan, or
              the coastal plain and piedmont of Guatemala. The sacrifices in the
              two pyramids also differ in their patterns of movement. Most of
              the Moon Pyramid victims appear to have arrived in the city
              recently, but the majority of those from the Feathered Serpent
              Pyramid had lived in Teotihuacan for a long time before their
              death. Las proporciones de isótopos de oxígeno y estroncio fueron
              medidas en el esmalte de dientes de todos los sacrificios humanos
              de la Pirámide de la Luna, Teotihuacan, para investigar sus
              orígenes geográficos. Las proporciones de isótopos de oxígeno
              fueron medidas en huesos de todos los mismos individuos para
              determinar si ellos se habían reubicado o no desde su niñez en
              Teotihuacan o alguna otra región. La combinación de estas técnicas
              analíticas provee una resolución mucho mayor para identificar
              orígenes posibles porque involucra un grupo más grande de
              variables ambientales, por ejemplo, las proporciones de isótopos
              de oxígeno caracterizan temperatura, altitud, precipitación y
              humedad, y las proporciones de isótopos de estroncio reflejan la
              geología. Todos los individuos sacrificados, con una posible
              excepción, parecen haber nacido en un lugar extranjero. Estas
              regiones probablemente incluyen otras áreas dentro de la cuenca de
              México y la Sierra Central, así como la Costa del Golfo y la
              Sierra Madre del Sur. Otras posibles regiones de origen son la
              Sierra Meridional, el Valle de Motagua y las Tierras Bajas Mayas.
              Hay una considerable superposición de las proporciones de isótopos
              de oxígeno entre las víctimas de la Pirámide de la Luna y las de
              la Pirámide de la Serpiente Emplumada, pero cada estructura
              contiene un grupo de individuos isotópicamente distintos. La
              Pirámide la Luna tiene un número de individuos con proporciones de
              isótopos de oxígeno mucho más altas, posiblemente indicativas de
              individuos de la Costa del Golfo o de las Tierras Bajas Mayas,
              mientras que la Pirámide la Serpiente Emplumada tiene un grupo
              distinto de individuos con proporciones de isótopos de oxígenos
              muy bajas, posiblemente indicativas de Oaxaca, Michoacan o la
              Llanura Costanera y el Pie de Monte de Guatemala. Los sacrificios
              en las dos pirámides también difieren en sus patrones de
              movimiento. La mayoría de los de la Pirámide de la Serpiente
              Emplumada habían vivido en Teotihuacan por largo tiempo antes de
              su muerte, mientras que la mayoría de las víctimas de la Pirámide
              la Luna parecen haber llegado a la ciudad recientemente desde el
              extranjero.",

              Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) consisted of 2 factors;
              dosage of N,P,K fertilizer (with 3 levels) and plant spacing (with
              2 levels). Each treatment was repeated 4 times. The data obtained
              analyzed with analysis of variance and followed with Duncan
              Multiple Range Test at 5\% level if any significant influences.
              The results showed that the interaction between plant spacing of
              30x40 cm and urea, Sp36 and KCl 300Kg-1ha significantly increased
              the number of tillers and diameter of arrowroot respectively. The
              use of plant spacing 30x40 cm tends to increase growth and better
              yield. The use of 300 Kg-1ha Urea, SP36 and KCl fertilizer
              significantly increased plant height, while 150 Kg/ha urea, SP36

               demineralization, gelatinization and ultra-filtration to select
               only higher molecular weight protein fragments for isotopic
               analysis. The latter method was developed for problematic (i.e.
               poorly-preserved) samples and while it is more rigorous, it is
               also significantly more expensive and more labor-intensive. Our
               aim is to find out whether there is any difference between the
               δ13C and δ15N of bone collagen isolated from relatively
               well-preserved bones using the two methods. Our sample set
               consists of 5 modern and 47 archaeological animal and human bones

               Archaeological specimens range in age from a few hundred to

               archaeological specimens provides unique insight into the
               paleoecology of animals utilized by humans in the past.
               Unfortunately, many archaeological specimens are too fragile to
               survive the mechanical processes necessary to accurately identify
               and sample incremental dental tissues. Polymethyl-methacrylate
               (PMMA) is an organic polymer often used to encapsulate and
               strengthen archaeological specimens for the sectioning, grinding,
               and polishing necessary to identify incremental tissues. The
               effects of PMMA embedding on stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes
               in dental enamel and dentin has not been assessed previously and
               may be relevant whenever stable isotopic analysis of carbon and
               nitrogen is to be conducted. We embedded five caribou (Rangifer
               tarandus) tooth halves in PMMA, sampled these halves and the
               corresponding non-embedded tooth halves. We found that PMMA
               embedding has no noticeable effects on the nitrogen values of
               embedded specimens. PMMA embedding decreased the δ13C values of
               whole teeth powder by an average of −6.5‰ and increased \%C by an
               average of 8.7\%. We then tested two methods to mitigate the
               impact of PMMA embedding on dental carbon 1) acetone baths to
               dissolve the PMMA before SIA, and 2) acetone baths combine with a
               modified Longin method for collagen extraction to remove PMMA
               prior to SIA. We found that three, four and five acetone baths
               appear to be equally efficient at removing PMMA introduced carbon
               from embedded specimens. Acetone baths reduce the standard error
               of δ13C values of whole tooth dental powder, including enamel,
               dentin, and cementum, in both embedded and non-embedded
               specimens. Both methods were successful at reducing the effects
               of PMMA embedding; however, the most efficient mitigation of PMMA
               effects on whole tooth carbon was found in collagen extracts
               coupled with acetone baths. This information may be helpful in
               future stable isotope assessments of PMMA-encapsulated dental
               tissues.",

              understand the diversity of technological traditions that

              spanning the Early Preclassic period to the arrival of European
              conquerors (1250 b.c.-a.d. 1521). Shared technological elements
              common to the region are outlined that reveals the existence of a
              long-term ``collective memory'' in the manufacture of shell
              objects, as well as those elements which seem particular to

              particularly interesting, as some tools and materials common to

              characterize the shape and size of biological organisms, have been
              applied within zooarchaeology over the past decade to address
              animal domestication processes and to refine morphological
              criteria to differentiate between taxa. However, there has been
              limited utilization of these methods to discriminate between
              populations of the same taxa to challenge and refine other key
              archaeological issues, such as migration and connectivity in
              prehistory. Presented here is a novel application of a
              three-dimensional landmark based geometric morphometric approach
              to address the nature of long distance trade and connectivity on
              the prehistoric Silk Road. The similarity of Bronze and Iron Age
              archaeological cultures along this steppe route has encouraged
              characterisations of these people as nomads, with highly mobile,
              integrated, and connected human and animal populations. However,
              the interconnectedness of domestic animal populations, in
              particular sheep (Ovis aries), the foundation of this prehistoric
              pastoral economy, has never been examined. This study utilized
              geometric morphometric methods to quantify geometric morphometric
              variance of O. aries astragali between three geographically
              disparate settlement sites within a single Final Bronze age
              cultural and chronological context. Significant differences
              between morphotypes revealed that protracted mobility patterns
              were unlikely and that while animal exchange may have occurred, it
              was not pervasive enough to produce a uniform sheep morphotype
              across central and southeastern Kazakhstan. The result of this new
              application of geometric morphometric methods challenges models of
              uniform and undifferentiated long distance mobility and economic
              connectivity between the peoples of the Silk Road.",

               dialogues between owls and human beings recorded in
               Nahuatl-language sources from the sixteenth century. Since
               ancient times, owls have been considered omens of death in
               Mexico. This article analyzes the cultural and linguistic context
               of this belief among the contact-period Nahuas: the import of
               tetzahuitl (omens) in the animistic worldview of the Aztecs, as
               well as the characteristic semantic pair in tecolotl, in
               chiquatli (“the owl, the barn owl”) to signify the lethal
               activities of the most representative messengers of the Lords of
               Death and Destiny, Mictlantecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca. Moreover,
               the essay shows how the ancient Nahuas considered the
               intelligibility of animal languages and engaged in active
               dialogues with the animal representatives of the gods, a form of
               communication that encompassed both the private and public

               dual-isotope approach (87Sr/86Sr and δ18Op) to reevaluate the
               proportion of in-migration at Tlajinga and includes data from two
               additional apartment compounds, Tlajinga 17 and 18 (n = 23). New
               results indicate that migrants comprised ~45\% of the Tlajinga
               population. Previously acquired radiocarbon dates combined with
               mortuary and isotope data suggest that immigration to Tlajinga
               was highest during the first centuries of compound occupation.
               Nevertheless, migration was a continual process throughout its
               history. Additionally, a new finding suggests that residents of
               Tlajinga 33 ingested foods with higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than did
               those of Tlajinga 17 and 18. We hypothesize that the
               incorporation of imported lime for the nixtamalization process
               skewed the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of human remains, a potentially
               important finding for future studies at Teotihuacan.",

               bone, teeth, or antlers) can be used to infer the geographic
               region that an animal or human inhabited, because different
               regions tend to have distinct Sr isotope compositions, and
               natural variations in the relative abundance of Sr isotopes are
               not changed as Sr is processed through the food chain. Therefore,
               an organism that ingests Sr from one region can have a Sr isotope
               composition that is different than that of an organism that
               ingests Sr from another region. The Sr isotope composition of
               skeletal elements is a reflection of the concentration-weighted
               average of dietary Sr that was ingested while that skeletal
               element was produced. Because different skeletal elements grow
               and exchange Sr at different stages during the life times of
               organisms, Sr isotope analysis of different skeletal elements can
               be used to infer changes in geographic location at different
               stages in an organism's life. The Sr isotope composition measured
               in human teeth will reflect the average Sr isotope composition
               that was ingested as a child, due to the immobile nature of Sr
               and Ca in teeth after formation, whereas the Sr isotope
               composition of bone will reflect the average isotopic composition
               over the last ten years of life, due to continuous biological
               processing of Sr and Ca in bone. Inferring the average isotopic
               composition of dietary Sr is best done by analyzing skeletal
               fragments from control groups, which might be animals that have
               the same feeding habits as the animal in question, or, in the
               case of humans, analysis of close family relatives. In cases
               where it is not possible to construct a Sr isotope database from
               control groups, it becomes necessary to estimate the isotopic
               composition of dietary Sr based on geologic principles. We
               present three case studies from our research that illustrate a
               range of approaches: (1) results from a criminal case where a
               deer was illegally harvested and the location of the deer was
               important to establish, (2) a pilot study of commingled human
               remains from a burial in Vietnam, associated with the Vietnam
               Conflict, and (3) a study of 13th and 14th century migration of

               stable isotopic data from human bone, dentine and tooth enamel to
               reconstruct Kaminaljuyu’s dietary history. Stable carbon isotope
               ratios and alkaline earth ratios of enamel carbonate indicate a
               decline in maize consumption from Preclassic to Classic periods,
               perhaps due to the desiccation of Lake Miraflores, which was used
               to irrigate Late Preclassic fields. Stable oxygen and strontium
               isotope ratios in enamel shed light on the geographic origin of
               Early Classic skeletons, and show that the central skeletons in
               the tombs were local children. However, four decapitated skulls
               and two peripheral skeletons show enriched oxygen ratios, similar

              qualitative osteological methods, including the collection of
              taxonomic data, the recording of bone modification, and the ageing
              and sexing of animal bones to address broader archaeological
              questions. Metrical analyses, including geometric morphometrics,
              the use of scanning electron microscopy, thin sectioning, and
              biomolecular analyses have all added to the types of quantitative
              data with which we can explore (zoo)archaeological questions.
              These zooarchaeological data cannot only be transformed into
              knowledge of the cultural and socioeconomic roles of animals in
              the past, but can also inform on larger ecological and
              socioeconomic structures; they can tell us about palaeoe-thology
              and palaeobiogeography, site formation processes and use of space
              within sites, consumption patterns, and religious and ritual
              practices. The study of animals in archaeology should not be
              viewed as an obscure specialisation with little outside relevance;
              indeed, it is a critical component to understanding broader
              patterns in both the environmental and social realms. The
              applications of stable isotope geochemistry are numerous , and its
              use as an analytical technique in archaeology has progressed
              substantially over the past few decades. For example, some early
              stable isotope studies in archaeology focused on analysis of
              oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O) from biogenic carbonate of marine
              molluscs (e.g. Deith 1983, 1985, 1986; Shackleton 1973) to
              reconstruct season of collection, and by extension, season of site
              use. Sampling shells for palaeoenvironmental information has
              become a well-established practice (e.g. Burchell et al. 2012,
              2013; Mannino et al. 2003, 2007; Milner 2002). Early analyses of
              carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) from archaeological human
              bone collagen (e.g. Chisholm et al. 1982; Shoeninger and DeNiro
              1984; van der Merwe 1982) used analyses of modern animal tissues
              and bone collagen as a baseline for establishing dietary
              differences between marine/terrestrial and C 3 /C 4 plant-based
              diets in ancient human populations. While subsequent research has
              continued to pursue and elaborate on these types of questions, the
              papers in this volume are testament to the fact that the
              applications of stable isotope analyses in archaeology are broad
              in scope. They include projects that use δ 18 O, δ 13 C, and δ 15
              N, as well as strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and sulphur (δ 34 S) to
              investigate questions about human and animal diet, seasonal
              transhu-mance and herding strategies, economic exchange networks,
              species biogeography and climate. One of the continuing challenges
              for stable isotope analysis as a methodological technique is its
              successful integration with existing archaeological knowledge.
              When stable isotope analysis is used to discuss topics in
              zooarchaeology, it is increasingly important to understand the
              ecology, physiology, and osteological development of sampled taxa
              in order to interpret stable isotope data. This volume grew out of
              a 1-day conference, ``Integrating Zooarchaeology and Stable
              Isotope Analyses'', which I organised at the McDonald Institute
              for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge, on 21 June
              2012. A selection of papers on research in the Old World presented
              at the conference (Çakırlar and Şeşen, Stevens et al., Madgwick et
              al., Hammond and O'Connor, and Arnold et al.) is joined in this

              Iron Age, Roman, and Mediaeval Britain; and the Early Iron Age

              there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild
              animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates
              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426-822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations
              within these felid populations further substantiates the
              postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated
              throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed
              from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have
              been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or
              delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and
              display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were
              routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to
              be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in
              order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes.",

               are some of the utmost anthropogenic impacts that threaten
               tropical birds in human-modified landscapes (HMLs). The degree of
               these impacts on birds' diet, habitat use, and ecological niche
               can be measured by isotopic analysis. We investigated whether the
               isotopic niche width, food resources, and habitat use of bird
               trophic guilds differed between HMLs and natural landscapes (NLs)
               using stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen isotopes (δ15N). We
               analyzed feathers of 851 bird individuals from 28 landscapes in
               the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We classified landscapes into two
               groups according to the percentage of forest cover (HMLs ≤ 30\%;
               NLs ≥ 47\%), and compared the isotopic niche width and mean
               values of δ13C and δ15N for each guild between landscape types.
               The niches of frugivores, insectivores, nectarivores, and
               omnivores were narrower in HMLs, whereas granivores showed the
               opposite pattern. In HMLs, nectarivores showed a reduction of
               44\% in niche width, while granivores presented an expansion of
               26\%. Individuals in HMLs consumed more resources from
               agricultural areas (C4 plants), but almost all guilds showed a
               preference for forest resources (C3 plants) in both landscape
               types, except granivores. Degraded and fragmented landscapes
               typically present a lower availability of habitat and food
               resources for many species, which was reflected by the reduction
               in niche width of birds in HMLs. Therefore, to protect the
               diversity of guilds in HMLs, landscape management strategies that
               offer birds more diverse habitats must be implemented in tropical
               regions.",

               postclassic and early colonial periods used feathers and

               rituals. They acquired these prestige items through gift
               exchange, trade, conquest, and tribute. This article explores a
               series of meanings that Nahuas attached to birds, plumes, and
               feather objects when worn on the body, exchanged in rituals, and
               discussed in historical accounts. It argues that while Nahuas
               clearly appreciated feathers for their aesthetic value, they also
               used them to tell histories of Nahua people’s origins, their
               feats, and their expansion through commerce and conquest. This
               article finds that the association between plumes, political
               authority, and personal and state histories made feathers
               especially potent symbols in narratives and images of the rise of

               Mammal A B S T R A C T Bone collagen of modern and ancient
               animals is a useful tissue for isotope analyses because it is
               stable over time. However, uncertainty regarding metabolic
               turnover processes of bone collagen can make isotope analysis
               difficult to correlate with relevant life history information. We
               used radiocarbon (14 C) dating to examine turnover within
               cortical bone and to investigate retrospective isotope ratios
               along the growth direction of mid-shaft femurs of several large
               mammals with long lifespan , including brown bear (Ursus arctos),
               sika deer (Cervus nippon), Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus),
               and Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata). The individuals examined
               died between 1971 and 1986, and their bones were thus expected to
               contain radiocarbon generated by nuclear bomb testing, which led
               to an atmospheric 14 C spike around 1964. Therefore, 14 C dating
               could be used to date sections of cortical bone at fine scale.
               The 14 C ages in the bone sections of all specimens except the
               Japanese serow specimen showed similar trends; perimedullary bone
               sections contained younger carbon, which has depleted 14 C after
               the peak of the 14 C spike, whereas 14 C ages became rapidly
               older in midcortical sections before gradually becoming younger
               towards the bone surface. We observed metabolic turnover of
               collagen driven by bone remodelling in perimedullary bone
               sections, but we observed no evidence of remodelling in
               midcortical and pericortical sections. Thus, our results confirm
               that bone collagen in femoral cortical bone records retrospective
               isotopic information during skeletal growth of mammals and
               suggest that entire femoral cortical bone of aged terrestrial
               mammals represents isotopic values during adolescence rather than
               an average value from several years prior to death.",

               remains discovered in graves at four main ceremonial sites -
               SipÁn, San José de Moro, El Brujo, and Moche - provides evidence
               of 12 sacrificed species including domestic animals such as
               llamas, dogs, and guinea pigs, and wild animals such as bats and
               parrots. A comparison of zooarchaeological data with Mochica
               iconography shows that animals served a variety of ritual
               purposes, for example, as mortuary food and as guides for souls
               of the dead in the afterlife. They were also considered to be
               mediators between the world of the living and that of the dead.

              program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and
              systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide
              sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the
              poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
              solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top
              10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for
              the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default
              Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and
              scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein

              Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides)
              while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for

              available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked

              Palaeopathology is the study of in vivo lesions in the skeleton.
              Archaeozoology uses animal remains from archaeological sites to
              study the relationship between people and animals. The connection
              between these concepts is that while all archaeozoological finds
              are subject to some kind of taphonomic process, only a certain
              number originate from diseased animals. Palaeopathology developed
              special features in archaeozoology, since contemporary human
              interference must always be reckoned with in archaeological
              assemblages. Animal remains occur as scattered-food refuse so that
              most diagnoses are isolated from their biological context. This
              paper reviews through various examples why a taphonomic approach
              to palaeopathological studies is of utmost significance. Résumé La
              taphonomie étudie la déprédation sur des os d’animaux après la

              vivant. La zooarchéologie étudie le rapport entre animaux et
              humains à l’aide des restes d’animaux. Le rapport entre les trois
              approches est que chaque trouvaille zooarchéologique est soumise à
              un processus taphonomiques et seul un certain nombre d’entre elles
              provient d’animaux malades. La paléopathologie a développé des
              apports uniques en archéozoologie parce qu’il est nécessaire de
              tenir compte de l’interférence humaine contemporaine dans les
              collections archéologiques. Les restes d’animaux résultent de
              restes alimentaires diffus. À cause de cela, la plupart des
              éléments diagnostiques sont isolés de leur contexte biologique.

              az jellemzi, hogy míg minden állatcsontlelet tafonómiai
              változásokon esik át, csak viszonylag kevésen figyelhetõk meg

               on trade and economic activity in the region of Puebla-Tlaxcala
               during the Late Postclassic period (AD 1200–1519).
               Ethnohistorical sources describe the Aztec Triple Alliance as
               constantly at war with settlements in the Tlaxcala region. To
               weaken their Tlaxcalteca rivals, the Aztecs imposed a trade
               blockade to reduce the flow of resources into Puebla-Tlaxcala.
               This article uses archaeological evidence to evaluate the
               effectiveness of this blockade. It compares the types of obsidian
               used to manufacture lithic tools from Aztec-controlled sources
               with those used within Puebla-Tlaxcala. Information from the
               large center of Tepeticpac and the small obsidian workshop site
               of Cinco Santos II, both in the Tlaxcala domain, are compared to
               other sites in Central Mexico prior to and during the height of
               Aztec influence. The results show little difference in regional
               trade patterns: obsidian from Sierra de las Navajas and Otumba
               was used in proportions in the Tlaxcala region in the Late
               Postclassic similar to those used during earlier periods. If an

               technological revolution that spans scientific achievements and
               day-to-day practices. The tools and methods from this digital
               change have also strongly impacted archaeology. Image-based 3D
               modeling is becoming more common when documenting archaeological
               features but is still not implemented as standard in field
               excavation projects. When it comes to integrating
               zooarchaeological perspectives in the interpretational process in
               the field, this type of documentation is a powerful tool,
               especially regarding visualization related to reconstruction and
               resolution. Also, with the implementation of image-based 3D
               modeling, the use of digital documentation in the field has been
               proven to be time- and cost effective (e.g., De Reu et al. 2014;
               De Reu et al. 2013; Dellepiane et al. 2013; Verhoeven et al.
               2012). Few studies have been published on the digital
               documentation of faunal remains in archaeological contexts. As a
               case study, the excavation of the infill of a clay bin from
               building 102 in the Neolithic settlement of Ҫatalhöyük is
               presented. Alongside traditional documentation, infill was
               photographed in sequence at each second centimeter of soil
               removal. The photographs were processed with Agisoft Photoscan.
               Seven models were made, enabling reconstruction of the excavation
               of this context. This technique can be a powerful documentation
               tool, including recording notes of zooarchaeological
               significance, such as markers of taphonomic processes. An
               important methodological advantage in this regard is the
               potential to measure bones in situ in for analysis after
               excavation.",

              developed for a specific context and later reused in other
              contexts and applications, depending on their ease of use and
              perceived applicability. While there might be statistical reasons
              to use a particular similarity index, the results of other
              measures should be taken into account as well, as various
              similarity measures do not necessarily have similar contextual
              meaning. Two entities can be similar with respect to a certain
              similarity criterion but may be distinct in terms of another.
              Thus, an understanding of the mathematical logic behind a method
              is crucial to the interpretation of the resulting network of
              similarities. We review a number of methods from the literature,
              for constructing similarity networks among disparate entities,
              regarding their applicability on data from archaeological sites.
              Formally, given an N X p matrix of N entities with p distinct
              classes of attributes, how are the entities comparable to each
              other with respect to the kinds of attributes they share? We
              distinguish three qualitatively different families of similarity
              measures for deducing relationships among entities that may
              meaningfully map onto various distinct social phenomena, such as
              migration, material acquisition, and movement of goods and skills,
              among others. Entities can be compared based on: (a) non\{uniform
              weighting of attributes, (b) asymmetric dominance relationships,
              and (c) rank correlations. We ground the significance and
              distinction of these classes of measures by giving comparative and
              contextual examples of selected methods on a case study of
              archaeological collections pertaining to 1200–1500 CE from the US
              Southwest region. We attempt to elucidate the differences in
              outcomes and their meanings when choosing various similarity

               C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope ratios between individuals at
               different disease stages. Materials and methods: δ 13 C and δ 15
               N data from previously analysed skeletons without signs of
               infectious disease or physiological stress (n = 32) were compared
               to new data from skeletons with active (n = 6), healed (n = 7) or
               a combination of both lesions (n = 10). Skeletons with lesions (n
               = 23) were also grouped as having only healed tibial periostitis
               (n = 7), generalised non-specific (n = 5) and generalised
               specific infections (n = 2). The skeletons with lesions that did
               not fit into these groups (n = 9) were not used in this analysis.
               Results: The δ 15 N from skeletons with non-specific generalised
               infections in several bones differed significantly when compared
               to skeletons that had either only healed tibial periostitis or
               were without lesions. Skeletons with venereal syphilis had
               similar mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N to either skeletons without signs
               of disease or those with only healed tibial periostitis.
               Discussion: These results suggest different diets may be linked
               into an individual's susceptibility to these pathogens. Diet
               influences resistance to infectious disease, while infections
               decrease nutrient availability, increase malabsorption and
               resting energy expenditure. Potentially therefore, combining
               isotopic evidence of diet with pathology may contribute to a new
               understanding of health and lifestyle in the past.",

               photosynthesis causes C4 plants and C3 plants to have distinct
               carbon-isotope signatures. In addition, marine C3 plants have
               stable-isotope ratios of carbon that are intermediate between C4
               and terrestrial C3 plants. The direct incorporation of the
               carbon-isotope ratio (13C/12C) of plants into consumers' tissues
               makes this ratio useful in studies of animal ecology. The heavy
               isotope of nitrogen (15N) is preferentially incorporated into the
               tissues of the consumer from the diet, which results in a
               systematic enrichment in nitrogen-isotope ratio (15N/14N) with
               each trophic level. Consequently, stable isotopes of nitrogen
               have been used primarily to assess position in food chains. The
               literature pertaining to the use of stable isotopes of carbon and
               nitrogen in animal trophic ecology was reviewed. Data from 102
               studies that reported stable-isotope ratios of carbon and (or)
               nitrogen of wild birds and (or) mammals were compiled and
               analyzed relative to diet, latitude, body size, and habitat
               moisture. These analyses supported the predicted relationships
               among trophic groups. Carbon-isotope ratios differed among
               species that relied on C3, C4, and marine food chains. Likewise,
               nitrogen-isotope ratios were enriched in terrestrial carnivorous
               mammals relative to terrestrial herbivorous mammals. Also, marine
               carnivores that ate vertebrates had nitrogen-isotope ratios that
               were enriched over the ratios of those that ate invertebrates.
               Data from the literature also indicated that (i) the
               carbon-isotope ratio of carnivore bone collagen was inversely
               related to latitude, which was likely the result of an inverse
               relationship between the proportion of carbon in the food chain
               that was fixed by C4 plants and latitude; (ii) seabirds and
               marine mammals from northern oceans had higher nitrogen-isotope
               ratios than those from southern oceans; (iii) the
               nitrogen-isotope ratios of terrestrial mammals that used xeric
               habitats were higher than the ratios of those that used mesic
               habitats, indicating that water stress can have important effects
               on the nitrogen-isotope ratio; (iv) there was no relationship
               between body mass and nitrogen-isotope ratio for either bone
               collagen or muscle of carnivores; and (v) there was linear
               covariation between stable-isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen
               in marine food chains (but not in terrestrial C3 or C4 food
               chains), which is likely a product of increases in carbon-isotope
               ratio with trophic level in marine food chains. Differences in
               stable-isotope composition among trophic groups were detected
               despite variation attributable to geographic location, climate,
               and analytical techniques, indicating that these effects are
               large and pervasive. Consequently, as knowledge of the
               distribution of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen increases,
               they will probably become an increasingly important tool in the
               study of avian and mammalian trophic ecology.",

               intra-sample variation was observed in δ-values obtained using
               IR-laser ablation, some of which arose from methodological
               challenges associated with this method. Further, δ13C values
               obtained using IR-laser ablation were lower than those acquired
               by conventional analysis, likely because of contamination from
               organic matter in the samples. Isotopic compositions of
               structural carbonate samples obtained by micromilling were less
               variable. For both methods, however, significant differences in
               δ13C and δ18O values were observed for different bone surfaces.
               These variations may indicate differences in the isotopic
               compositions of food and water incorporated into osteons over a
               lifetime, and illustrate the relationship between bone
               remodelling and isotopic heterogeneity in bone. Overall, our
               results highlight the difficulties of using the IR-laser ablation
               method for measuring isotopic compositions of bone.",

               hunting for trade between approximately 150 BC and 370 AC. In
               this study, I analyzed the avian component of the
               zooarchaeological remains to examine patterns in resource use and
               paleoecological conditions during site occupancy. For comparison,
               I also identified the bird bones from three archeological sites
               in the Valdivia Valley, 38 km to the north. The composition of
               the avifauna at the El Azúcar site is highly unusual. Unlike at
               any other sites, including the Valdivia Village sites examined in
               this study, songbirds and small ground doves make up over 90\% of
               all samples. The large number of songbirds and columbids is
               probably due to a combination of (1) taphonomy, (2) the use of
               1/8 in. mesh for screening of sediments during excavation, and
               (3) local adaptations in resource use. Novel hypotheses regarding
               the exploitation of birds by the Guangala people of El Azúcar are

               probably hunted by women and children in and around agricultural
               plots, perhaps by using fishing nets. The avifauna at El Azúcar
               and the Valdivia Village suggest that climate was variable,
               consistent with the expected impact of the El Niño Southern
               Oscillation on the Ecuadorian coast. These insights could not

               mosaic of isozones. Large-scale importation of animals to the
               Danebury sites from distant regions that have different isotopic
               baseline values is possible. However, the practical requirements
               of this model (i.e. long distance trade networks maintained in
               terms of frequency, proportion and source of animals over 500
               years) make this improbable. Rather, we propose a model that
               includes distinct ecological isozones within the Danebury
               Environs landscape, with some animals from each of the sites
               consuming foodstuff from different isozones for most of their
               lives. This likely involves control of the landscape on a
               communal probably kinship basis, with individuals having access
               to certain parts of the landscape at certain times. The landscape
               could be seen as being made up of numerous interlocking
               activity-territories, defined in both space and time, remembered
               and inherited. Irrespective of which model proves to be the most
               accurate, these results paint a picture of complex land
               management during the Iron Age.",

              struggle with the unpredictable nature of the Holocene.
              Fine-grained analyses of bioarchaeological materials offer
              excellent opportunities to overcome some of the difficulties
              encountered in such studies that tackle the effects of changing
              environmental and climatic conditions on human civilisations
              during the Holocene. This paper explains the results of a pilot
              study that uses archaeological freshwater clams (Unio elongatulus)
              from northern Syria as intermediary anthropobiogenic proxies to
              infer about the seasonal rhythms of local pluvial regimes and
              their possible fluctuations at the turn of the third millennium
              bc. Having secreted their CaCO3 in chemical and periodical
              accordance with the ambient environment and ending up at tell
              sites through human activity, these bivalves are suitable vessels
              of information about human ecology in northern Syria at the end of
              third millennium bc. Marked differences were observed between the

               isotopic composition of the whole body of an animal reflects the
               isotopic composition of its diet, but the animal is on average
               enriched in δ13C by about 1‰ relative to the diet. In three of
               the four cases examined, the 13C enrichment of the whole body
               relative to the diet is balanced by a 13C depletion of the
               respired CO2. The isotopic relationships between the whole bodies
               of animals and their diets are similar for different species
               raised on the same diet and for the same species raised on
               different diets. However, the δ13C values of whole bodies of
               individuals of a species raised on the same diet may differ by up
               to 2‰. The relationship between the 13C/12C ratio of a tissue and
               the 13C/12C ratio of the diet depends both on the type of tissue
               and on the nature of the diet. Many of the isotopic relationships
               among the major biochemical fractions, namely the lipid,
               carbohydrate and protein fractions, are qualitatively preserved
               as diet carbon is incorporated into the animal. However, the
               difference between the δ13C values of a biochemical fraction in
               an animal and in its diet may be as large as 3‰. The δ13C values
               of the biochemical components collagen, chitin and the insoluble
               organic fraction of shells, all of which are often preserved in
               fossil material, are related to the isotopic composition of the
               diet.These results indicate that it will be possible to perform
               dietary analysis based on the determination of the 13C/12C ratio
               of animal carbon. Analysis of the total animal carbon will in
               most cases provide a better measure of diet than the analysis of
               individual tissues, biochemical fractions, or biochemical
               components. The limits of accuracy of this method will generally
               restrict its application to situations in which the diet is
               derived from sources with relatively large differences in their
               δ13C values, such as terrestrial vs aquatic organisms or C3 vs C4
               plants. The method should be applicable to fossil as well as to
               living material.",

              implicitly treated as isotopically equivalent, but recent research
              has determined that carbonatee carbon and e oxygen isotopic
              compositions of these two tissues may be offset by several per
              mil. Here, we compare the isotopic compositions of co-forming bone
              and enamel from juvenile humans. We also assess the impact of a
              standard pre-treatment procedure for the removal of organic matter

              compositions and on bioapatite crystallinity and carbonate

              phosphatee oxygen isotopic data from paired enamel and bone remain
              suitable for determining resi- dential history, whereas the
              isotopic compositions of carbonatee oxygen and e carbon from

               for changes in δ18O of consumed water. Until now, providing this
               information at the seasonal scale, across broad periods of an
               individual's life, has been considered impossible because bone
               remodeling was thought to completely disrupt meaningful patterns
               preserved in bone microstructure. Recent studies, however, have
               described large (often > 1 mm) deposits of incremental primary
               bone persisting well into adulthood, and new technology permits
               finer scale analysis than ever before. Our objective was to
               determine the δ18O variation across human primary bone layers
               using high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
               (SIMS). Results show patterned sinusoidal periodicity, similar to
               expectations for weather-induced fluctuations in seasonal
               drinking water. The bone formation rate suggested by the isotopic
               variation in our study is consistent with other histological

               thus enables sampling of δ18O at approximately monthly intervals

               native peoples along the Pacific Coast of Central America from El
               Salvador to the Nicoya Peninsula (Costa Rica) are best understood
               as part of the Mesoamerican periphery. The Central American
               peoples south of Nicoya formed both a chiefly world-system of
               their own and part of the Mesoamerican frontier by engaging in
               networks of trade and preciosity exchanges with the coastal
               Mesoamericans in Nicoya and Nicaragua. Support for this argument
               is based primarily on two “microhistoric” case studies of peoples
               located on both sides of the Mesoamerican/Lower Central America
               border, specifically the Chorotegans of the Masaya/Granada area
               of Nicaragua and the Chibchans of the Diquis/Buenos Aires area of
               Costa Rica. Archaeological information on sites in both areas and
               documentation from Spanish colonial sources that refer to native
               peoples in these areas strongly indicate that the Masaya/Granada
               peoples were active participants in the Mesoamerican regional
               network. In contrast, information from the Diquis/Buenos Aires
               area for this period reveals only weak Mesoamerican ties but
               strong relations with a Chibchan intersocietal network of
               chiefdoms.",

              de carnivore familie Ursidae (Mammilia, Carnivora). In het

               indicate that the Nile was the main source of drinking water for

               our understanding of ancient populations. The competing
               influences of meteoric water versus protein intake on human bone
               collagen hydrogen isotope values were examined through comparison
               with the well-understood proxies of hydroxyapatite oxygen and
               collagen nitrogen isotopes, respectively. Consideration of the
               data set as individual points compared to averaged pools of
               individuals in each of 11 archaeological sites suggested the
               latter partially eliminates inherent variability due to food
               choice or regional movement. Collagen hydrogen isotopes were
               moderately correlated with hydroxyapatite oxygen isotopes (R =
               0.695, site averages) and collagen nitrogen isotopes (R = 0.562,
               site averages). Correlation improved with a multiple linear
               regression including both oxygen and nitrogen (R = 0.745, site
               averages). Correlation between meteoric water hydrogen and oxygen
               isotope values converted from hydroxyapatite and collagen values,
               respectively, yielded a slope well below the expected value of ∼8
               observed directly in meteoric water (i.e. the “meteoric water
               line”). Correlation between converted meteoric water hydrogen and
               the measured collagen non-exchangeable hydrogen isotope values
               showed a slope well below the expected value of 1.0. Theoretical
               meteoric water hydrogen isotope values and theoretical
               herbivorous collagen hydrogen isotope values were calculated
               based on previously established equations in order to construct a
               hypothetical framework free of trophic level influences.
               Deviations between actual values and these theoretical values
               correlated weakly with collagen nitrogen isotope values,
               suggesting that direct trophic level enrichment/depletion is not
               controlling the disparity between expected and measured values.
               The deviations are hypothetically caused by non-local food
               sources, and a decoupling of expected oxygen and hydrogen
               relationships as individuals consumed more meat and decreased in
               vivo non-essential amino acid production. This work presents a
               new model that facilitates understanding of the complex
               relationship between meteoric water and protein intake controls
               on hydrogen isotopes in omnivorous human populations that can
               potentially inform about past meteoric water values and amounts

              increasingly popular tool to study past human migrations. It is
              based on the assumption that human body chemistry preserves the
              δ18O of precipitation in such a way as to be a useful technique
              for identifying migrants and, potentially, their homelands. In
              this study, the first such global survey, we draw on published
              human tooth enamel and bone bioapatite data to explore the
              validity of using oxygen isotope analyses to identify migrants in
              the archaeological record. We use human δ18O results to show that
              there are large variations in human oxygen isotope values within a
              population sample. This may relate to physiological factors
              influencing the preservation of the primary isotope signal, or due
              to human activities (such as brewing, boiling, stewing,
              differential access to water sources and so on) causing variation
              in ingested water and food isotope values. We compare the number
              of outliers identified using various statistical methods. We
              determine that the most appropriate method for identifying
              migrants is dependent on the data but is likely to be the IQR or
              median absolute deviation from the median under most
              archaeological circumstances. Finally, through a spatial
              assessment of the dataset, we show that the degree of overlap in
              human isotope values from different locations across Europe is
              such that identifying individuals’ homelands on the basis of
              oxygen isotope analysis alone is not possible for the regions
              analysed to date. Oxygen isotope analysis is a valid method for
              identifying first-generation migrants from an archaeological site
              when used appropriately, however it is difficult to identify
              migrants using statistical methods for a sample size of less than
              c. 25 individuals. In the absence of local previous analyses, each
              sample should be treated as an individual dataset and statistical
              techniques can be used to identify migrants, but in most cases
              pinpointing a specific homeland should not be attempted.",

              (87Sr/86Sr) for identifying migration within Lapita populations
              and their commensal animals, specifically the pig (Sus scrofa).
              Lapita people (ca. 3300–2200BP) were the initial colonists of the
              island groups to the east of the Solomon Islands, spreading from
              Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa within a few centuries.
              Mobility is assumed to have been an important mechanism for
              maintaining cultural solidarity between Lapita communities. It has
              been previously argued that Lapita populations became
              progressively more sedentary over time after the initial
              colonising events. Two Lapita sites, Kamgot and Balbalankin, from
              the Anir Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago are included in the
              analysis and fall within the Early (ca. 3300–3000/2900BP) and
              Middle (ca. 3000/2900–2700BP) Lapita periods respectively. Ten
              tooth enamel samples from Lapita human and pig teeth as well as
              modern teeth were analysed for strontium isotopes. The mean values
              for the individuals from both sites were higher than the
              geological value obtained for the Anir Islands reflecting the
              incorporation of marine-derived strontium into their tooth enamel
              taken up in their diet. Although the sample sites have similar
              environments there was a difference between the local ranges of
              the strontium isotopic data. One Lapita age pig and one
              potentially modern pig from Kamgot fell well outside the local
              distribution for the site and were considered to be non-local. The
              extreme distribution of the two outliers suggests they came from
              two geographically separate locations. The results from the Anir
              Islands when compared with strontium results from other
              prehistoric Pacific Island populations suggest there is sufficient
              variation between island groups in terms of the biologically
              available strontium to justify further research. The present
              results are discussed in terms of using pigs as a proxy for human
              mobility as well as an indicator for the ‘local’ range of an
              archaeological population by treating human and pigs as separate
              populations. Strontium isotopes therefore provide the opportunity
              to investigate migration in Lapita populations on a finer scale
              than was previously possible.",

               delivered by the small vertebrate assemblages in Middle East
               archaeological sites, we performed a taxonomic and taphonomic
               study of the small mammal remains found in pellets from Barn owl
               (Tyto alba) from a poorly known region of South of Turkey at the
               Syrian border, east of Euphrates River. This will constitute the

              whose northernmost habitat is 500km to the south, suggest that
              Paquimé had relationships with distant communities. Here, carbon
              and oxygen stable isotope analysis of 30 macaw bones determines
              whether the Paquimeños actively bred these parrots or traded with
              Mesoamerican groups to obtain the birds. The δ13C values indicate
              that the macaws ate a diet of C4 plants, foods that were
              unavailable to wild macaws. In addition, δ18O data suggest that
              the majority of the macaws spent their entire lives at Paquimé. We
              conclude that the ancient Paquimeños were in fact breeding scarlet
              macaws, although one bone with δ18O values outside the local range

              about the economic and ideological interdependence of pre-Hispanic

              Teotihuacan (ad 1–ad 550) in the Basin of Mexico provides evidence
              for leporid (cottontails and jackrabbits) breeding and/or
              management within a residential complex of the city, Oztoyahualco.
              The present study tests this notion by analyzing Teotihuacan
              leporid bone collagen samples (n = 134) for stable isotope ratios
              of carbon (δ13Ccollagen) and nitrogen (δ15Ncollagen) to provide
              information on ancient leporid diet and ecology. Results
              demonstrate that carbon-stable isotope values from Oztoyahualco
              specimens are significantly higher than those from other contexts
              at Teotihuacan and from a sample of modern specimens from the
              region. These data are consistent with the notion that leporids
              from Oztoyahualco consumed diets high in C4 and CAM plants, such
              as the human-cultivated staples of maize (Zea mays), nopal cactus
              (Opuntia sp.), and maguey (Agave sp.). Nitrogen-stable isotope
              results show no significant differences between Oztoyahualco and
              other contexts, suggesting that Oztoyahualco leporids inhabited
              similar environments, ate food grown on similar soils, and were
              feeding at the same trophic level. When considered in combination
              with archaeological data and previously published isotopic
              results, δ13Ccollagen data from Oztoyahualco support the idea that
              leporids were artificially provisioned by humans, consistent with
              the hypothesis that they were bred and/or managed through human
              labor. More broadly, these results hint that food production at
              Teotihuacan was at least in part conducted by specialized workers
              in a manner similar to that of commercialized market economy of
              the later Aztec Empire (ad 1428–1521).",

              research on ancient empires from the Old World and South America.
              Empires can be identified from three types of evidence:
              characteristics of the capital city, evidence for varying types of
              political domination of provincial areas, and examples of the
              projection of influence in a larger, international context. We

              is controlled by a conserved set of receptor proteins and
              downstream components. MtSYMREM1, a protein of the Remorin family
              in Medicago truncatula, was shown to interact with at least three
              receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that are essential for RNS. Remorins
              are comprised of a conserved C-terminal domain and a variable
              N-terminal region that defines the six different Remorin groups.
              While both N- and C-terminal regions of Remorins belonging to the
              same phylogenetic group are similar to each other throughout the
              plant kingdom, the N-terminal domains of legume-specific group 2
              Remorins show exceptional high degrees of sequence divergence
              suggesting evolutionary specialization of this protein within this
              clade. We therefore identified and characterized the MtSYMREM1
              ortholog from Lotus japonicus (LjSYMREM1), a model legume that
              forms determinate root nodules. Here, we resolved its
              spatio-temporal regulation and showed that over-expression of
              LjSYMREM1 increases nodulation on transgenic roots. Using a
              structure-function approach we show that protein interactions
              including Remorin oligomerization are mainly mediated and
              stabilized by the Remorin C-terminal region with its coiled-coil
              domain while the RLK kinase domains transiently interact in vivo
              and phosphorylate a residue in the N-terminal region of the
              LjSYMREM1 protein in vitro. These data provide novel insights into
              the mechanism of this putative molecular scaffold protein and

              palaeodietary research, the vulnerability of carbonates to
              diagenesis necessitates careful sample preparation. The most
              common preparation method involves dilute acetic acid treatments
              to remove highly soluble mineral contaminants. However, there is
              variation in both treatment time and acid concentration. This
              study addresses the impact of such variation on carbonate δ13C and
              δ18O, sample loss in solution, and sample Fourier transform
              infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characteristics. Samples of fresh and
              archaeological bone were treated with 1.0 M and 0.1 M acetic acid.
              Carbonate δ13C and δ18O, sample loss and FTIR characteristics were
              measured at treatment times of 4 to 24 h. The results suggest that
              4 h of treatment suffice to remove highly soluble contaminants,
              and that longer treatment times can lead to sample
              recrystallization. Some samples treated with 1.0 M acid showed
              unacceptable loss or possible recrystallization, suggesting that
              0.1 M acid treatment is preferable. However, the more dilute acid
              caused smaller shifts in δ13C and δ18O for all samples and
              treatment times. Thus, while 0.1 M acid appears to produce
              superior sample quality, it may not produce results directly
              comparable to those of 1.0 M acid treatments. This has important
              implications for the comparison of apatite carbonate stable

              holistic subsistence analyses, and collaborative publications
              towards this endeavor have become more numerous in the literature.
              However, there are relatively few attempts to qualitatively
              integrate zooarchaeological (animal) and paleoethnobotanical
              (plant) data, and even fewer attempts to quantitatively integrate
              these two types of subsistence evidence. Given the vastly
              different methods used in recovering and quantifying these data,
              not to mention their different preservational histories, it is no
              wonder that so few have undertaken this problem. Integrating
              Zooarchaeology and Paleoethnobotany takes the lead in tackling
              this important issue by addressing the methodological limitations
              of data integration, proposing new methods and innovative ways of
              using established methods, and highlighting case studies that
              successfully employ these methods to shed new light on ancient
              foodways. The volume challenges the perception that plant and
              animal foodways are distinct and contends that the separation of
              the analysis of archaeological plant and animal remains sets up a
              false dichotomy between these portions of the diet. In advocating
              qualitative and quantitative data integration, the volume

              suitability of data integration in any particular case, and (2)
              carrying out an integrated qualitative or quantitative approach. ©

               interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple,
               intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and
               interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to
               detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists.
               This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut
               definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes
               disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of
               the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide
               definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more
               general and critical than typically found in traditional
               introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for

               violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting
               analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can
               lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is
               correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis
               is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25
               misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power.

               of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) dated to the sixteenth and
               seventeenth centuries AD in what is today the Czech Republic and
               offers an analysis and discussion of written historical sources.
               Altogether, 45 bones of turkey (Meleagris) from ten
               archaeological sites and a further six bones probably also of
               turkey (cf. Meleagris) are known from both sub-regions of the
               Czech Republic, that is, Bohemia and Moravia, and from a variety
               of contexts. Many of the bones originate from contexts of high
               social status (especially those from Prague Castle);
               interestingly, four of the ten contexts represent a clerical or
               monastic setting. The extensive sample from a range of
               geographical and socio-cultural contexts enables various
               analyses. Osteometrically, the early Czech turkeys, which
               probably weighed between 3 and 9 kg, resemble their wild
               ancestor. The management of breeding and slaughtering is
               reflected in the variety of ages and sexes. Cut marks undoubtedly
               suggest butchering and subsequent eating. The written sources
               from the end of the sixteenth and in the seventeenth century
               prove that turkey was on the menu of those of high social class,
               which we see from the earliest reliable written Czech record from
               1578, which describes a festal menu for the wedding of Vilém of
               Rožmberk (Rosenberg), one of the most powerful men in Bohemia.
               Different sources suggest that either 450 or 600 turkeys were
               served at the feast. From as early as 1583, we have a written
               record, although an isolated one, which suggests the early spread
               of the turkey into the rural environment and among the lower
               nobility. Considering archaeological dating, historical records
               from 1578, and their absence from earlier records, the domestic
               turkey was probably introduced to and spread across the Czech
               lands as late as between the 1950s and 1980s of the sixteenth
               century. The history of the peacock—although later it would be
               replaced on the dining table by turkey—is longer; the first
               written record of its being bred in Bohemia dates from around
               1125–1140. According to other records, the pheasant, another
               imported Galliform bird, was known in Bohemia in 1330. The
               keeping of the wild form of turkey is documented much later;
               certainly in 1801, but very probably already in 1781.",

              environmental conditions, and populational or individual migration
              in bioarchaeological research. A standardized method for the
              stable isotopic analysis of skeletal carbonate has not yet been
              established, despite the importance of these data. In this study,
              significant differences in the stable oxygen isotope values of
              bones and dental enamel were observed, which arose due to
              instrument-and methodology-based differences. The same target
              archaeological samples were analyzed in three laboratories, and
              the stable isotope analyses were supplemented by Fourier
              Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements, which
              detected a strong OH − concentration-dependence in the stable
              oxygen isotopic shifts measured between the three laboratories.
              Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of
              reaction temperature and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) concentration
              on the oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate, both of which
              resulted in significant, though smaller δ 18 O changes than the
              OH-related δ 18 O change. As such, we suggest that the δ 18 O
              values of bone structural carbonate should not be included in
              anthropological interpretation and that the analysis of tooth
              enamel should be conducted at 70 °C using 102\% H 3 PO 4 , in
              order to make the results comparable. Furthermore, carbonated

               species of cultivated plants (n = 91) and 139 wild plant species
               collected in northern Peru. The cultivated plants were collected
               from nineteen local markets. The mean d 13 C value for maize
               (grain) was 211.860.4 \% (n = 27). Leguminous cultigens (beans,
               Andean lupin) were characterized by significantly lower d 15 N

              animal domestication. Domestication involves both biological and
              cultural components. Creating a category of domestic animals means
              constructing and crossing the boundaries between human and animal,
              culture and nature. The concept of domestication thus structures
              the thinking both of researchers in the present and of
              domesticators and herders in the past. Some have argued for
              abandoning the notion of domestication in favor of a continuum of
              human-nonhuman animal relationships. Although many human-animal
              relationships cannot be neatly pigeonholed as wild or domestic,
              this paper contends that the concept of domestication retains its
              utility. There is a critical distinction between animals as a
              resource and animals as property. Domestication itself had
              profound consequences for the societies and worldview of the
              domesticators and their descendents. In addition to the material
              effects of animal wealth, domestic animals provide both a rich
              source of metaphor and a model of domination that can be extended

              with the metrics they provide serve as a knowledge base while
              applied practically on such relevant topic as the Social Network
              Analysis (SNA). Focusing on Gephi as an SNA tool, simple to use

              SNA. It is evident that the SNA metrics and a display of the
              structure of the nodes and interactions are useful and potentially
              effective for an online analysis of interaction patterns.
              Integrating this SNA approach into the educational context will
              allow the teacher to detect and diagnose the social climate and
              act according to the results. Finally, we present conclusions

              Measurements of collagen concentrations in tooth and bone, atomic

              359 historic and prehistoric African humans, and modern and
              prehistoric East African non-human mammals are described. Carbon
              isotope ratios of collagen lipids from four bones are also
              presented. Compared to bone, whole teeth have significantly lower
              collagen concentrations, lower carbon and nitrogen concentrations
              in collagen, and similar C:N ratios. Carbon and nitrogen
              concentrations and C:N ratios are relatively constant over a wide
              range of collagen concentrations. However, prehistoric specimens
              with very low collagen concentrations have highly variable C:N
              ratios, very low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in collagen,
              and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios unlike collagen. At
              the transition from well-preserved to poorly preserved collagen
              the most reliable indicator of collagen preservation is the
              concentration of carbon and nitrogen in collagen. Concentrations
              of C and N drop abruptly by an order of magnitude at this

              assessing sample quality. Since collagen preservation can vary
              greatly within prehistoric sites, these attributes should be
              reported for each specimen. Use of purification procedures that

              (carbonates, fulvic acids, lipids, humic acids, sediments and
              rootlets) are recommended. Wider adoption of these procedures
              would insure comparability of results between laboratories, and
              permit independent and objective evaluation of sample

               was the capital of a Maya kingdom from ca. AD 400 to 800. These
               human remains come from both royal tombs and less elaborate
               burials dating to the early part of this period and lie deep in
               the accumulated architectural layers of the Acropolis. We present
               a brief summary of the context, contents, and external links
               represented by these interments. Several lines of evidence point
               to connections between early Copan and Teotihuacan in the Central
               Highlands of Mexico, and Tikal in the central Maya lowlands of
               the Petén in Guatemala.The bioarchaeology of the interred
               individuals from the Copan Acropolis is summarized in terms of
               major characteristics and life history. The focus of this study
               is the isotopic investigation of these individuals, which
               included both light and heavy isotopes. We have measured carbon
               and nitrogen in some of the burials along with strontium, carbon,
               and oxygen in tooth enamel. In addition, we have a substantial
               database of strontium isotopes from human burials and both
               ancient and modern fauna at the site that help to characterize
               the local isotope ratio at Copan. This information is compared
               with the larger Maya region and the site of Teotihuacan in the
               Central Highlands of Mexico to examine questions of human
               migration and interaction in the Classic Maya period. Focus is on
               the primary burial identified as K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’, the first
               dynastic ruler of Copan. Epigraphic information on his early
               years and subsequent events in his life are compared to isotopic
               data on his place of birth and possible movements. The isotopic
               evidence suggests that several of the individuals buried in the
               Acropolis at Copan, including K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’, were not
               born in the local area, but came to this ancient city from

              teeth (M2 and M3) of 39 of excavated burials. The results show
              that the diet consumed by the majority of the population during
              childhood and adolescence had high 13C enriched values in both
              dietary components: δ13C enamel\_bioapatite = −2.0 ‰ ± 1.5 for the
              whole diet and δ13C dentine\_collagen = − 9.4 ‰ ± 2.1 for the

              to relate the enamel bioapatite data to the bone bioapatite of the

               87Sr/86Sr of water, bedrock, soils, and plants across a broad

               sources of dietary strontium (i.e., plants and water) in humans
               reflect the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of exposed bedrock, and second, to
               determine whether the ranges of 87Sr/86Sr values were
               sufficiently distinct among the principal Maya geocultural areas
               to infer past migration. We identified five distinct subregions
               on the basis of geologic maps and evaluated the variability of
               87Sr/86Sr values (values given as mean 87Sr/86Sr ±2 standard

               have remained debatable for over a century. China, and
               particularly northern China, has been claimed as one of the early
               centers for the domestication of chickens, because many alleged
               chicken bones have been discovered at a number of archeological
               sites. However, the identification of archeological domestic
               chicken bones from early Holocene sites in northern China remains
               contentious. The Neolithic chicken exploitation in southern China
               close to modern distribution area of wild red junglefowl (G.
               gallus) remained unclear, since analyses of bird bones were
               scarce in the region. To reveal the birds, especially chicken,
               exploitation in Neolithic southern China, we analyzed bird
               remains from Tianluoshan site which is located in the lower
               Yangtze River and is a ruin of large village in the Neolithic
               early rice cultivation society. Ducks (Anatinae), rails
               (Rallidae), and geese/swans (Anserinae) were dominant, suggesting
               that peoples in the Tianluoshan site got birds at inland and
               brackish waters environments near the site. Although two G.
               gallus size bones were found at the site, it is also included in
               the size range of five indigenous pheasants in the region and
               further studies are required for the species identification of
               the bones. Phasianidae bones occupied only 0.4\% of NISP,
               suggesting Phasianidae birds, including domestic chickens and red
               junglefowls, were rarely exploited in the Tianluoshan site. The
               results did not support the north-word expanded wild distribution
               of red junglefowl nor early Holocene chicken exploitation in the
               lower Yangtze River.",

               encompassing living animals, animal-derived by-products and
               artifacts made from animal bodies) have long played essential
               roles in state-level ritualized activities. This paper focuses on
               three zooarchaeological assemblages from the Classic Period Maya
               kingdom of Copan, Honduras (ad426–822), to describe how corporal
               animal forms were implemented to mediate power, express social
               identities and encapsulate contemporary socio-political
               circumstances. Two of these fundamental assemblages relate to
               world-creation myths associated with the Starry Deer-Crocodile, a
               mythological entity prominent in both contexts which was
               materialized into the ritual arena through a formalized process
               of commingling and translating animal body elements. The third
               context was deposited some three centuries later during the reign
               of Yax Pasaj, the last ruler of the Copan dynasty. This
               assemblage, extravagant with powerful felids conjuring the
               authority of the royal dynasty, reflects a period of acute
               socio-political struggle faced by the Copan dynasty. Detailed

              Papaloapan Basin, especially along the lower Blanco River, using
              statistical analyses of ceramic rims from recent surveys. This
              region is sandwiched between two known tributary provincial
              centers of the Aztec empire, but its relationship to the empire is
              uncertain in colonial documentary materials. Our analyses
              illuminate changes in social relations from the Middle (A. D.
              1150–1350) to Late Postclassic (A. D. 1350–1520) periods and shed
              light on the impact of Aztec imperialism. We use a ceramic
              unmixing procedure to assign collections to the Middle and Late
              Postclassic periods for assessment of settlement patterns. Next we
              use cluster analyses to examine vertical wealth and status
              differentiation. In the Middle Postclassic period, we observe a
              concentric gradation of wealth and status away from the small
              center of El Sauce. Late Postclassic changes include the decline
              of El Sauce and the founding of a new center at Callejón del
              Horno. The concentric model does not apply to the Late Postclassic
              period, however, and wealth and status became more highly
              concentrated at Callejón del Horno compared to its hinterland. We
              also investigate sparse collections-those with few Postclassic
              rims-to evaluate whether these collections represent poor
              residences or, rather, sherd scatter from possible field manuring.
              The lower Blanco region was likely integrated into the Aztec
              empire on the basis of changes in vertical social differentiation
              from Middle to Late Postclassic times and percentages of
              Aztec-style ceramics compared to known Aztec provincial centers,
              especially Cotaxtla.En este trabajo exploramos las relaciones
              sociales e imperiales en la cuenca oeste baja del Río Papaloapan,
              especialmente en el bajo Río Blanco, a través de análisis
              estadísticos de los bordes de cerámica recolectados en la
              prospección de superficie llevada a cabo durante el transcurso de
              dos décadas. Este región se localiza entre de dos centros
              regionales y tributarios conocidos, pero su relación con el
              imperio Azteca es ambigua en las fuentes escritas. Los resultados
              de estos análisis indican cambios en las relaciones sociales del
              Postclásico Medio (1150–1350 d. C.) al Postclásico Tardío
              (1350–1520 d. C.) y proporcionan información acerca del impacto
              que tuvo el imperio Azteca en la región. Usamos un procedimiento
              estadístico de desunión de la cerámica (ceramic unmixing) para
              asignar las colecciones al Postclásico Medio o Tardío y así
              evaluar los patrones de asentamiento. Posteriormente realizamos
              dos análisis estadísticos de agrupaciones para examinar la
              diferenciación vertical de riqueza y de la posición social. En el
              período Postclásico Medio, observamos un patrón concéntrico de
              riqueza y estatus jerarquizados cuyo núcleo es el centro pequeño
              de El Sauce, y a partir del cual se desminuye gradualmente la
              riqueza y el nivel de estatus. Los cambios del Postcásico Tardío
              incluyen el descenso de El Sauce y la fundación de un nuevo centro
              en Callejón del Horno. Sin embargo, el modelo concéntrico no se
              aplica al período Postclásico Tardío, y la riqueza y el estatus se
              observan muy concentrados en Callejón del Horno en comparación con
              su periferia. Nuestra investigación acerca de la diferenciación
              social vertical también incluye el análisis de colecciones
              reducidas-las que tienen pocos bordes de cerámica Postclásica-para
              evaluar si estas colecciones representan residencias pobres, o
              tiestos esparcidos por el posible efecto de la aplicación de abono
              en los campos de cultivo. Los cambios en la diferenciación social
              vertical del Postclásico Medio al Tardío y los porcentajes de la

              investigation and in more general educational activities;
              nevertheless, methodologies and their associated software are both
              relatively expensive to use. As well, measurements of 3D models
              must be comparable to that of originals if they are to be used in
              scientific research. The aim of this study was to determine the
              degree of error in measurements taken from 3D models and from the
              original skulls of Algerian hedgehogs (Atelerix algirus) using a
              freeware program. To do so, we measured the repeatability (ri) of
              four biometric measurements of 14 skulls of this North-African
              hedgehog species. We generated 3D models of skulls of 14 specimens
              from the collection in Barcelona Natural History Museum using the
              NextEngine scanner and free software and a low-price computer. The
              same observer measured each variable twice for each skull using
              three different methodologies: (i) measurement of the original;
              (ii) measurement of 3D models projected onto a screen with no zoom
              (i.e. replicating the original skull size) and (iii) measurement
              of 3D models projected onto a screen with the maximum possible
              zoom. The repeatability within each method (INTRAMETHOD) and
              between methods (INTERMETHOD: original vs. screen No-zoom;
              original vs. screen zoom) were tested. The methods per se were
              either very highly repeatable (ri > 90\%) or very repeatable (ri >
              0.75), the only exception being a difference in the length of the
              median palatine on the screen with no zoom (ri: 0.64) due to a
              single outlier. When comparing digital models, our data suggest
              that measurements taken from skull borders are more reliable than
              those in which measurements are taken from sutures due to the
              differences in the contrast obtained in the finish of the 3D
              models. Thus, the contrast in 3D models needs to be improved,
              possibly by means of digital treatment. Our results suggest that
              the 3D models obtained using the scanner NextEngine and edited
              using open-access freeware (Meshlab®) are comparable with original
              specimens and so are a good alternative for museums with fewer

               between species in vitamin D metabolism and susceptibility to
               rickets and osteomalacia. Most herbivores produce vitamin D3 in
               response to sunlight, but dogs and cats have generally lost the
               ability as carnivore diets are rich in vitamin D. Nutritional
               deficiencies and/or poor exposure to sunlight can induce rickets
               in birds, swine, cattle and sheep, but horses are less
               susceptible as they have evolved a calcium homeostasis that is
               quite different than other animals. Adaptations to specific
               environments also affect disease incidence: llamas/alpacas out of
               their natural high altitude intense solar radiation environments
               are highly susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. The pathology of
               rickets/osteomalacia is similar across species, however fibrous
               osteodystrophy is more common and may also be present.
               Rickets/osteomalacia were likely more common in animals before
               the advent of commercial diets, but can be difficult to
               definitively diagnose especially in single archeological

              We observed the weaning process in a habituated wild wolf pack
              (Canis lupus) on Ellesmere Island, Canada, from estimated ages 5
              through 10 weeks (including a continuous record for 192h). The

              bouts initiated by the nurser, persistence by pups, and mean
              duration of suckling bouts. Variables that increased with age were
              interbout interval, percentage of suckling bouts terminated by the
              nurser, and wincing or agonistic actions of the nurser. Behavioral
              conflict appeared in the developmental stage (estimated age 7 8

              Countertactics by pups to obtain milk were not apparent, although

              In this group of wolves, weaning mechanisms were a complex
              function of food delivery by adults, discomfort of the nursing
              female as pups developed, and declining persistence of pups. If
              there is a conflict over what is optimal for pups and for the
              nurser in the ultimate sense, behavioral conflict is more likely
              to be expressed with regard to access to meat, or as conditional
              tactics dependent on food availability, rather than weaning
              conflict being controlled by fixed rules in this species.",

              contexts that generate bone surface modifications have been
              well-studied in experimental archaeology but the ways in which cut
              mark size or morphology change with time during butchery in
              response to tool edge dulling or carcass desiccation is currently
              unknown. This study examines cut mark cross-sectional width and
              depth change during a sequence of experimental butchery trials
              that control for the effects of animal size, bone portion density,
              tool weight, and flake versus core tool type. Mark size is
              measured from vinyl molds under low-power magnification (40×) and
              compared to more precise 3d measurement techniques. Tool type and
              the order of carcass segment defleshing was systematically varied
              across the experiment, and a linear mixed effect regression model
              was used to explore the impact of these fixed factors and consider
              random variability introduced by potential differences in the four
              cows butchered by eight tools. Mark width and depth samples were
              negatively related to the density of the portion where marks
              occur, tool weight had a weak, but significant influence on mark
              size, and marks incised at different stages in the sequence of
              defleshing events were similar in width and depth. With current
              measurement techniques and the large variability in mark size
              produced during butchery, it is not impossible to infer the timing
              of mark creation during a tool's use life or its place in a
              sequence of butchery events, but methodological advancement may

               populations, and the timing and intensity of turkey husbandry
               remain unanswered. This study applied ancient mitochondrial DNA
               and stable isotope ( δ 13 C, δ 15 N) analysis to 55
               archaeological turkey remains from Mexico to investigate
               pre-contact turkey exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different
               (sub)species of turkeys were identified in the archaeological
               record ( M. g. mexicana , M. g. gallopavo and M. ocellata ),
               indicating the exploitation of diverse local populations, as well
               as the trade of captively reared birds into the Maya area. No

               Mesoamerica and the Southwest USA, in contrast with
               archaeological evidence for trade of other domestic products.
               Isotopic analysis indicates a range of feeding behaviours in
               ancient Mesoamerican turkeys, including wild foraging, human
               provisioning and mixed feeding ecologies. This variability in
               turkey diet decreases through time, with archaeological, genetic
               and isotopic evidence all pointing to the intensification of
               domestic turkey management and husbandry, culminating in the

               People of the Americas processed maize through nixtamalization, a

               alkaline solution. Once discarded, nixtamalization wastewater may

               significance in mortuary behaviours. We analysed bird remains
               from the Verteba Cave cemetery, located in western Ukraine and
               occupied by the Tripolye during phase BII through CII. Bird
               remains (n = 178) comprise approximately 2\% of the faunal sample
               excavated among human burials from the cave. In contrast to
               species represented symbolically in Tripolye art, water and marsh
               birds are majorly underrepresented. The bird assemblage is
               dominated by grouse (Tetrao spp.), and common quail (Cortunix
               cortunix), but also includes birds of prey, corvids, and many

               that the avifauna from Verteba Cave are likely the remains from
               funeral feasts or food grave offerings. It also supports the idea
               that birds were a seasonal and local economic resource. The

              There are many measures that can be derived from a set of
              identified specimens. They can be transformed into minimum numbers
              of individuals, they can be weighed, they can be used to estimate
              the size of the death population, they can be transformed into
              animal weights, and so on. However, all of these measures start
              with the identified specimen. For many years, the number of
              identified specimens (NISP) per taxon was used as the standard
              measure of taxonomic abundance within archaeological faunas. Bones
              from a given fauna were identified, numbers of identified
              specimens per taxon determined, and the NISP values themselves
              used to examine changing taxonomic frequencies through time and
              across space. Excavated by Dorothea Garrod during the late 1920s

               with an emphasis on zooarchaeology and stable isotope analysis.
               On the basis of the chemical composition of the collagen and the
               relationships between the collagen and mineral phases, fish bone
               is more susceptible to biotic and abiotic degradation than
               mammalian bone and is therefore less likely to be recovered in
               archaeological deposits. The amino acid composition of fish bone
               differs from that of mammals, most notably with respect to
               hydroxyproline content. The C:N ratio of fish collagen is,
               however, very similar and slightly lower than mammalian collagen,
               and thus the traditional range of acceptable C:N ratios for
               archaeological bone collagen (2.9-3.6) should not be shifted or
               extended for fish on the basis of the amino acid composition of
               collagen. An extensive survey of published archaeological bone
               collagen C:N ratios demonstrates that fish collagen from
               archaeological contexts tends to have significantly higher C:N
               ratios than mammalian collagen. The elevated C:N ratios in fish
               bone collagen may be the result of abiotic degradation processes
               that occur within the bone after death, the presence of exogenous
               humic contaminants, or endogenous lipid contaminants. © 2011

              ancient DNA evidence combine to confirm the identification and
              context. The natural pre-Hispanic range of the Mexican turkey does
              not extend south of central Mexico, making the species non-local
              to the Maya area where another species, the ocellated turkey
              (Meleagris ocellata), is indigenous. Prior to this discovery, the

              approximately one thousand years later. The El Mirador specimens

              those of other taxa and identification of bone to species is often
              difficult or impossible. We explore a new identification system,
              ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry), which is based upon
              protein barcoding. As proteins can be cleaved enzymatically and
              analyzed by mass spectrometry in a repeatable way, protein
              barcoding is used widely in microbiological contexts for quick and
              inexpensive protein identification; mass spectra reflect the
              differences in protein sequence and can therefore be reproducibly
              linked to a particular protein or protein fragment. ZooMS uses
              peptide fingerprinting of bone collagen as a method for rapid
              identification of archaeological bone. This has involved the
              identification of masses related to peptides of known sequence.
              For mammals, sufficient sequence information is available for this
              approach but for groups, such the teleost fish, species are highly
              diverse and there are few available collagen sequences. Here we
              report a preliminary investigation into the identification of fish
              species by peptide mass fingerprinting that does not require
              sequence information. Collagen mass spectra are used to identify
              eight species of bony fishes (Osteichthyes) from four orders:
              Clupeiformes, Salmoniformes, Gadiformes, and Perciformes. The
              method is applied to both modern and archaeological fish remains
              and offers the capacity to identify traditionally unidentifiable
              fish fragments, thus increasing the Number of Identified Specimens

               (δ 18O) of intake water in order to reconstruct paleoclimate from
               the δ 18O of fossil biogenic phosphate. The principal oxygen

               flux relative to atmospheric O2, CO2, and water vapor flux at
               larger size (i.e., water flux increases relatively faster than
               metabolic rate and surface area with increasing body size). These
               results suggest that the largest fossil taxa should be used for
               paleoclimate reconstruction because (1) potential errors are
               smallest at large body sizes and (2) drinking water forms a
               larger proportion of the oxygen intake. Paleoclimate
               reconstruction based on the δ 18O of biogenic phosphates can thus
               be corrected for body-mass fractionation effects, a significant
               cause of previously uncharacterized interspecific variation.",

  abstract  = "Radiogenic strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) have long been used in
               analyses of paleomobility within Mesoamerica. While considerable
               effort has been expended developing 87Sr/86Sr baseline values
               across the Maya region, work in central Mexico is primarily
               focused on the Classic period urban center of Teotihuacan. This
               study adds to this important dataset by presenting bioavailable
               87Sr/86Sr values across central Mexico focusing on the Basin of
               Mexico. This study therefore serves to expand the utility of
               strontium isotopes across a wider geographic region. A total of
               63 plant and water samples were collected from 13 central Mexican
               sites and analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr on a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune
               multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
               (MC-ICP-MS). These data were analyzed alongside 16 published
               87Sr/86Sr values from two additional sites within the region of
               interest. A five-cluster k-means model was then generated to
               determine which regions of the Basin of Mexico and greater
               central Mexico can and cannot be distinguished isotopically using
               87Sr/86Sr values. Although the two clusters falling within the
               Basin of Mexico overlap in their local 87Sr/86Sr ranges, many
               locations within the Basin are distinguishable using 87Sr/86Sr
               values at the site-level. This study contributes to paleomobility
               studies within central Mexico by expanding knowledge of strontium
               isotope variability within the region, ultimately allowing
               researchers to detect intra-regional residential mobility and
               gain a greater understanding of the sociopolitical interactions
               between the Basin of Mexico and supporting outlying regions of
               central Mexico.",

               collagen from animals that fed exclusively in the marine
               environment are, on average, 9\%. more positive than those from
               animals that fed exclusively in the terrestrial environment;
               ranges for the two groups overlap by less than 1\%. Bone collagen
               δ15N values also serve to separate marine fish from the small
               number of freshwater fish we analyzed. The bone collagen δ15N
               values of birds and fish that spent part of their life cycles
               feeding in the marine environment and part in the freshwater
               environment are intermediate between those of animals that fed
               exclusively in one or the other system. Further, animals that fed
               at successive trophic levels in the marine and terrestrial
               environment are separated, on average, by a 3\%. difference in
               the δ15N values of their bone collagen. Specifically, carnivorous
               and herbivorous terrestrial animals have mean δ15N values for
               bone collagen of + 8.0 and + 5.3\%., respectively. Among marine
               animals, those that fed on fish have a mean δ15N value for bone
               collagen of + 16.5\%., whereas those that fed on invertebrates
               have a mean δ15N value of + 13.3\%. These results support
               previous suggestions of a 3\%. enrichment in δ15N values at each
               successively higher trophic level. In contrast to the results for
               δ15N values, the ranges of bone collagen δ13C values from marine
               and terrestrial feeders overlap to a great extent. Additionally,
               bone collagen δ13C values do not reflect the trophic levels at
               which the animals fed. These results indicate that bone collagen
               δ15N values will be useful in determining relative dependence on
               marine and terrestrial food sources and in investigating trophic
               level relationships among different animal species within an
               ecosystem. This approach should be applicable to animals

               The study of over 35,000 fish remains showed that 391 individuals
               from 63 species and 35 families were present. Seven species were

               locations. Most had lived in Teotihuacan for a prolonged period
               before their death. This pattern suggests foreign “recruitment”
               or mercenary behavior. The women had either lived all their lives
               in Teotihuacan or had moved from there to a foreign location.
               Most of the individuals in the center of the pyramid (burial 14)
               did not come from Teotihuacan, nor had they lived in the city
               long before their deaths. We suggest that the choice of victims
               was meant to demonstrate Teotihuacan's powerful ideology to the
               rest of the Mesoamerican world. Notably, this isotopic evidence
               of physical interaction between Teotihuacan and foreign regions
               considerably predates the currently existing archaeological
               evidence.",

              gallopavo) extends from Mexico to southeastern Canada and to the
              eastern and southern regions of the USA. Six subspecies have been
              described based on morphological characteristics and/or
              geographical variations in wild and domesticated populations. In
              this paper, based on DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial
              D-loop, we investigated the genetic diversity and structure,
              genealogical relationships, divergence time and demographic
              history of M. gallopavo populations including domesticated
              individuals. RESULTS: Analyses of 612 wild and domesticated turkey
              mitochondrial D-loop sequences, including 187 that were collected
              for this study and 425 from databases, revealed 64 haplotypes with
              few mutations, some of which are shared between domesticated and
              wild turkeys. We found a high level of haplotype and nucleotide
              diversity, which suggests that the total population of this
              species is large and stable with an old evolutionary history. The
              results of genetic differentiation, haplotype network, and
              genealogical relationships analyses revealed three main genetic
              groups within the species: mexicana as a population relict (C1),
              merriami (C2), and mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola (C3).
              Haplotypes detected in domesticated turkeys belong to group C3.
              Estimates of divergence times agree with range expansion and
              diversification events of the relict population of M. gallopavo in
              northwestern Mexico during the Pliocene-Pleistocene and
              Pleistocene-Holocene boundaries. Demographic reconstruction showed
              that an expansion of the population occurred 110,000 to 130,000
              years ago (Kya), followed by a stable period 100 Kya and finally a
              decline ~ 10 Kya (Pleistocene-Holocene boundary). In Mexico, the
              Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt may be responsible for the range
              expansion of the C3 group. Two haplotypes with different
              divergence times, MGMDgoB/MICH1 and MICH2, are dominant in
              domesticated and commercial turkeys. CONCLUSIONS: During the
              Pleistocene, a large and stable population of M. gallopavo covered
              a wide geographic distribution from the north to the center of
              America (USA and Mexico). The mexicana, merriami, and
              mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic groups originated
              after divergence and range expansion from northwestern Mexico
              during the Pliocene-Pleistocene and Pleistocene-Holocene
              boundaries. Old and new maternal lines of the
              mexicana/intermedia/silvestris/osceola genetic group were
              distributed within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt where
              individuals were captured for domestication. Two haplotypes are
              the main founder maternal lines of domesticated turkeys.",

               towards unusual high values masking the original terrestrial
               signature. It is unclear so far if and to what extend sea spray
               influences other stable isotopes besides sulphur. In this study,
               we examined if the effect was also detectable in carbon,
               nitrogen, and oxygen stable isotopes of bone collagen and
               carbonate, respectively.Multi-isotope data of mammals sampled
               from the Viking Haithabu and medieval Schleswig sites in Northern
               Germany were analysed according to a previously developed
               approximation procedure and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
               clustering in order to quantify the sea spray effect in the
               isotopes under study.While we were able to approximate an
               influence of the sea spray effect of at least 32.8\% and 62.8\%
               in δ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb, respectively, it was not possible to
               validate or approximate this effect in δ13Ccoll and δ15Ncoll.
               Indeed, detection of the sea spray effect not only in δ34Scoll,
               but also in δ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb is of particular importance for
               studies on both prehistoric and recent material.GMM clustering on
               terrestrial herbivorous and marine piscivorous mammals was used
               to confirm the existing influence and to validate the
               approximated correction for the sea spray effect in the
               respective isotopic ratios (δ13Ccarb, δ18Ocarb, δ34Scoll) and the
               correction for the limnic influence on δ15Ncoll approximated in a
               previous study. After correction, the clustering results markedly
               changed corresponding to the actual diet and habitat preference
               of the examined species. Although our study focused on
               palaeoecology, we suggest that GMM clustering also constitutes a
               very useful tool for modern landscape ecology based on stable

               means of carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements on human and
               animal bones from the site, as well as on modern animals from the
               region. The average δ13C value for Preclassic human bone collagen
               was −12.9±0.9‰ (n=28) and for tooth enamel apatite it was
               −8.7±2.3‰ (n=33); the average δ13N in bone collagen was 8.9±1.0‰
               (n=23). The archaeological faunal remains, in order of frequency,
               include white-tailed deer, freshwater turtle and dog, plus
               smaller numbers of armadillo, Brocket deer, peccary, and rodent.
               All of these are C3 plant eaters (ave. δ13C=−20.8‰, n=19), except
               dog (−15.6‰, n=12) and armadillo (−16.4‰, n=6). Archaeological
               plant remains include maize (estimated carbon and nitrogen
               isotope values −10‰, ∔3‰) and a variety of forest species. Marine
               foods are barely represented in the archaeological deposits. The
               archaeological and isotopic evidence together indicate that the
               people at Cuello made substantial use of maize, but were not
               dependent on it like later Maya populations. C4 carbon made up
               ca. 30–35 percent of their bone and tooth enamel apatite and
               50–55 percent of their bone collagen. This apparent discrepancy
               is the result of their eating dog and armadillo, both with
               substantial C4 components in their diets. The dogs were the size
               of large terriers, were slaughtered in their prime, and were
               apparently allowed to scavenge rather than being fed a high-maize
               diet to fatten them for the pot. The deer neither raided the
               cornfields nor were they intentionally fed maize. Feeding maize
               to deer and dogs are phenomena which were observed in historic
               times, but evidently developed after the Preclassic.",

               human tissue are based on the premise that δ18O values of potable
               water sources are relatively stable over time and vary
               predictably across the landscape. Local variability of δ18O is
               generally assumed to be negligible and negated by an averaging
               effect as oxygen is consumed primarily as imbibed liquid and
               incorporated into tissue. This study tests the assumption that
               variability of δ18O ratios of water from within a region are
               insufficient to impact the reconstruction of ancient mobility
               using isotopic measures of human tooth and bone. This case study
               focuses on the Maya area of Guatemala and Mexico, a region where
               many analyses of oxygen isotopic ratios in ancient human tissue
               has been conducted. 71 water samples were obtained over the
               course of five years, from precipitation, streams, rivers, lakes,
               aguadas (watering holes), civals (perennial wetlands), and caves.
               Unlike most baseline studies, the objective here was the repeated
               testing of a diversity of sources from the same location.
               δ18OVSMOW values from surface and meteoric water range from −
               16.0 to + 3.6‰. The precipitation range is − 16.0 to 1.58‰ (n =
               22) with the highest and lowest values measured at the same
               location (El Zotz, Guatemala). The surface water range is − 9.2
               to 3.6 (n = 48), the lowest value is the Usumacinta River at
               Yaxchilan and the highest value is from a lake located 65
               kilometers away. The δ18O values of local streams were remarkably
               stable over time. Major rivers, such as the Usumacinta River,
               have relatively constant values. Closed water basins (lakes,
               aguadas, and civals) demonstrated an evaporative effect and δ18O
               was variable both between basins and in individual basins over
               time. In the Petén region, mean δ18O of precipitation is
               statistically different than that of lake and aguada water. Local
               δ18O differences in consumed water likely explain the variability
               observed in human tooth enamel at Tikal and other Petén region
               sites. This case study demonstrates that local isotopic values
               may be more diverse than is generally assumed in studies of human
               mobility that rely on little to no baseline data. Future studies
               of mobility based on oxygen isotopic measures of ancient human
               tooth and bone should include measures of both meteoric water and
               a diverse range of surface and groundwater to develop more robust
               interpretations of oxygen isotopic values in ancient human
               tissue.",

               density data, which are used as a proxy measure of bone strength.
               Methods used to obtain these data are often either destructive,
               or expensive. Consequently the data available tend to be based on
               only a small number of animals. A method that can measure the
               bone density of a large number of animals at a comparatively low
               cost is therefore desirable. This paper sets out such a method,
               based on photodensitometry. Bones are radiographed, the images
               are converted into digital files, standardised, and their optical
               density measured. These data are combined with metrical
               information to produce a measurement that relates to a specimen's
               bone density. The method is shown to be repeatable and comparable
               to (or perhaps better than) Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry
               (DEXA) in terms of accuracy. It also does not suffer from the
               methodological problems regarding the cross-sectional area of the

               the method described here have successfully been used in a

               Çatalhöyük, Turkey, shedding light on the use of different types
               of space by the ancient inhabitants of the site. The same data

  abstract  = "C. K. Brain (e.g., 1981) documented an interesting difference in
               relative skeletal part representation between primates and bovids
               of similar live body size recovered from the fossil cave site of
               Swartkrans (South Africa). Hominids and baboons are represented
               primarily by skull parts and a paucity of postcranial bones,
               while small sized bovids (Size Classes 1 \& 2) are represented by
               more equivalent abundances of all skeletal elements. Brain argued
               that the Swartkrans bones were primarily carnivore collected, and
               postulated that the difference in element frequencies between
               primates and bovids is the manifestation of less durable primate
               postcranial skeletons relative to those of bovids when either are
               subjected to a destructive process such as carnivore feeding.
               Experiments by Brain (1981) in which baboon and bovid carcasses
               were fed to large, African carnivores lend support to this
               hypothesis. Bovid postcranial elements survived carnivore feeding
               more frequently and more completely than those of primates.
               Assuming that bulk bone mineral density (bulk BMD) is a measure
               of durability, we supplement Brain's observational data by
               presenting the first systematic, element-by-element comparison of
               baboon and bovid postcranial bulk BMD measurements obtained by
               dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). While the bovid in our
               sample exhibits greater absolute bulk BMD values in 57·8\% of all
               measured bone areas, when grouping areas by body region, a
               statistically significant difference in absolute bulk BMD values
               between the baboons and bovids is documented only in the hindlimb
               region (i.e., femur, tibia and patella). Density differences in
               other body regions are not statistically significant. Further, in
               only one case (i.e., small bovids in the Member 2
               [1948–1953/1965–1975 excavation] assemblage) is there a
               significant and positive correlation between skeletal part
               frequencies of primates or bovids and bulk BMD. This suggests
               that, for the most part, primate and bovid skeletal part
               representation at Swartkrans is not the result of
               density-mediated processes. Differences in skeletal part
               representation between primates and bovids at Swartkrans may thus
               be attributable to factors other than bone density—such as bone
               size, length, shape, and/or the relative palatability of
               surrounding soft tissues on bones.",

               models of diet over the time range from pre-Classic (1250 bc to
               250 ad) to Historic (1520 ad to 1670 ad) periods. The content of
               maize in the diet is inferred from δ13 C which is, in turn,
               negatively correlated with both Sr and Zn content. Maize
               constitutes about 50\% of the diet in the oldest pre-Classic
               samples, decreases in importance to a minimum of about 37\% in
               Terminal Classic times and subsequently rises to about 70\% of
               the total diet in post-Classic times. The δ15 N of collagen
               remains essentially constant over this 2000 year period [9·9 ±
               0·9 per mil (‰)], indicating essentially no change in the balance
               of protein sources, dominantly from wild and domesticated

              of terrestrial, herbivorous mammals larger than 1 kg. The goal of
              this model is to estimate the oxygen isotopic composition (S l8O)
              of intake water in order to reconstruct paleoclimate from the 6 “0
              of fossil biogenic phosphate. The prin- cipal oxygen inputs are
              liquid water, atmospheric O,, and oxygen in food. The principal
              outputs are water (liquid and vapor) and COI,. Body mass-dependent
              scaling equations are used to assign 02, H20, and CO2 fluxes. The
              model predicts that the S”O of body water is higher than the \&I80
              of intake water and ap- proaches the S’*O of intake water with
              increasing body size, as observed in empirical data. This reflects
              the increasing importance of liquid water flux relative to
              atmospheric 02, CO,, and water vapor flux at larger size (i.e.,
              water flux increases relatively faster than metabolic rate and
              surface area with increasing body size). These results suggest
              that the largest fossil taxa should be used for paleoclimate
              reconstruction because ( 1) potential errors are smallest at large
              body sizes and (2) drinking water forms a larger proportion of the
              oxygen intake. Paleoclimate reconstruction based on the S”O of
              biogenic phosphates can thus be corrected for body-mass
              fractionation effects, a significant cause of previously
              uncharacterized interspecific variation.",

              The diversity of birds in Central Mexico presents challenges to

              experimental characterization of different taphonomic
              modifications on bone surfaces, including anthropogenic cut marks.
              Until now, most research has been conducted evaluating
              experimental and non-altered cut marks, in order to obtain a
              better control of the studied variables. However, in
              archaeological contexts, bones are frequently subject to different
              taphonomic alterations and, in most cases, bone surfaces and the
              associated taphonomic signals show different grades of alteration.
              In this study, we present an experimental approach in which
              experimental cut marks were produced, mechanically altered,
              digitized, and analyzed using GMMs, in order to provide an
              in-depth characterization of how overlying taphonomic traces can
              alter cut marks. In the experiment, 40 cut marks were subjected to
              abrasion by a mixture of distilled water, sands, and gravels,
              using a tumbling machine in a series of cumulative cycles for a
              total of 4 h: cycle 1 (0.5′), cycle 2 (0.5′), cycle 3 (1 h) and
              cycle 4 (2 h). Cut mark cross-section profiles were then obtained
              using 3D digital microscopy, and a 2D 7-landmark designed for cut
              mark analyses were employed. Our results show a clear statistical
              differentiation among non-altered cut marks belonging to Cycle 0,
              and altered cut marks. The depth and opening angle of cut marks
              appear to be the features with a higher weight in the
              differentiation between altered and non-altered cut marks. On the
              other hand, there are no distinctions when differentiating between
              the diverse altered cycles. These results, like those previously
              obtained in an experimental approach using a binocular microscope,
              point to the limitation of the identification of cut marks and
              other taphonomic signals in archaeological contexts with altered
              bone surfaces, caused by the fast alteration and the loss of
              diagnostic criteria of the bone surface modifications.",

              localized, highly controlled by political actors, and static over
              long periods of time. In Mesoamerica, recent research has cast
              doubt on these views, with the recognition of early market place
              exchange, production by households for exchange, and the
              wide-ranging integration of communities into regional trade
              networks. Here, we expand on an earlier network analysis of
              obsidian assemblages from the Maya region during the Classic and
              Postclassic periods to incorporate data for all of Mesoamerica
              between 900 BC and AD 1520. Using both visual graphical
              representations and formal network metrics, we find that the
              Mesoamerican economy was dynamic and generally not highly
              centralized over time. The topology of this interactive network
              underwent significant changes over time. In particular, trends
              towards decreasing network hierarchy and size culminated in the
              highly commercialized “international” economy of Late Postclassic
              period as noted in previous studies. Based on this analysis, we
              make the case that the ancient Mesoamerican economy was neither
              predominantly top-down nor static, and so does not conform with
              oft-held presumptions regarding preindustrial economies.",

               skeletal remains when it is fundamental to distinguish between
               peri- and post-mortem lesions. Detecting biomarkers as specific
               indicators of vitality and survival to an injury, could enable us
               to solve the common problems encountered in the interpretation of
               ante-, peri- and post-mortem injuries due to the absence of
               perceptible bone signs at a macroscopical, microscopical and
               radio-graphical level. In order to do this, it is fundamental to
               study how cellular and biochemical markers react to time and
               taphonomy. The use of biomarkers might be a possible aid in the
               diagnosis of the timing of lesions, and as a subject is closely

               the Gulf Coast and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Other possible

              positive health effects. They are present in circulation after
              ingestion and absorption and can be sequestered into cells within
              particular organs, but have rarely been investigated
              systematically in osteological tissues. However, a small number of
              polyphenols and similar molecules are known to bind to bone. For
              example alizarin, a plant derived anthraquinone and tetracycline
              (a naturally occurring antibiotic), are both absorbed into bone
              from circulation during bone formation and are used to monitor
              mineralization in osteological studies. Both molecules have also
              been identified serendipitously in archaeological human bones
              derived from natural sources in the diet. Whether an analogous
              mechanism of sequestration extends to additional diet-derived
              plant-polyphenols has not previously been systematically studied.
              We investigated whether a range of diet-derived polyphenol-like
              compounds bind to bone using untargeted metabolomics applied to
              the analysis of bone extracts from pigs fed an acorn-based diet.
              We analysed the diet which was rich in ellagitannins, extracts
              from the pig bones and surrounding tissue, post-mortem. We found
              direct evidence of multiple polyphenolic compounds in these
              extracts and matched them to the diet. We also showed that these
              compounds were present in the bone but not surrounding tissues. We
              also provide data showing that a range of polyphenolic compounds
              bind to hydroxyapatite in vitro. The evidence for polyphenol
              sequestration into physiological bone, and the range and
              specificity of polyphenols in human and animal diets, raises
              intriguing questions about potential effects on bone formation and
              bone health. Further studies are needed to determine the stability
              of the sequestered molecules post-mortem but there is also
              potential for (palaeo)dietary reconstruction and forensic

              and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the
              late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric
              approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but
              this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate
              whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can
              be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic
              pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental
              factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate
              statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs
              (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild × domestic first generation
              hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried
              out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate
              the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found
              highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs,
              both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the
              basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also
              demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic
              breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation
              hybrid wild × domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild
              pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here
              represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic
              one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a
              quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus

              This is especially pertinent when working in locations where no

              archaeological assemblage cannot be transported to another
              facility. In order to fill this gap, we are building a virtual
              comparative faunal collection using a structured light scanner to
              scan modern skeletal material in 3D. The resulting high resolution
              3D color models are a valuable resource for identifying fossil
              specimens. Scan data can be converted into a variety of formats
              for viewing and can be transported on a portable digital device
              for use at field or laboratory localities. In addition, scans can
              be printed three dimensionally to produce a replica of the scanned
              skeletal part. A particular advantage of this digital technology
              is that we can eventually create a complete 3D representation of a
              taxon's skeleton from scans of several components of what are
              incomplete skeletons of one animal taxon in a museum collection.

              Teotihuacan population. Regarding the variation of each group, the
              Teotihuacan sample was found to have the greatest dispersion in
              terms of the morphology of the frontal sinuses. These data are
              consistent with the role played by this city as an economic,
              ideological and cultural centre. This research shows that the
              study of the frontal sinuses is a reliable marker in to establish
              biological affinities among ancient populations. One of its
              advantages is that it is feasible to include both complete skulls
              and fragments of frontal bones, thus enlarging the sample size.",

              emerging infectious diseases and the modern clinical epidemiology

              parasites that have infected humans and their ancestors throughout
              their evolution in Africa from those recent souvenir species to
              which humans have only become exposed following contact with
              animals during their migration across the globe. Ten such heirloom
              parasites are proposed, which appear to have been spread across
              the globe. Six further heirlooms are noted to have limited spread
              due to the constraints of their life cycle. Twelve souvenir
              parasites of humans are described, along with their animal
              reservoirs. While the origins of 28 species of endoparasite have

              underpin diagnosis in palaeopathology. Currently, the dominant
              approach is comparative: relationships between skeletal lesions
              and disease in a reference group in which there is independent
              evidence of the diseases present in individuals are used to
              identify disease in unknown archaeological skeletons on the basis
              of the lesions present. This is essentially a reference sample -
              target sample approach, analogous to that used to develop
              methodology in other areas of biological anthropology (e.g. age
              estimation in palaeodemography). As well as considerable
              strengths, this approach also has significant weaknesses. Many of
              these arise from the nature of the reference material (mainly
              pathology museum and other skeletal collections, and published
              collations of medical imaging data) used to develop diagnostic
              criteria. There may also be a tendency toward over-emphasis on
              pattern-matching between reference and target material, and an
              under-emphasis on developing our understanding of the biology of
              bone lesions. Despite its shortcomings, the comparative approach
              is likely to remain the foundation of most palaeopathological
              work, but we should increasingly augment it with other diagnostic
              approaches, especially those grounded in the pathophysiology of
              bony responses to disease.",

              contexts are based on units derived, in one way or another, from
              the number of identified specimens (NISP): the minimum number of
              elements (MNE), the ``minimal animal unit'' (MAU), and the
              skeletal-element based minimum number of individuals (MNI). MNE

              from a population of NISP values match in some specified way.
              Since this is the case, MNE values should scale to the NISPs for
              the body part involved. Since MAUs are generally calculated by
              standardizing MNE values by the number of times the part occurs in
              the skeleton, and MNIs by a combination of this and both age-and

               date, nearly all of our knowledge of the Triple Alliance empire
               is derived from ethnohistorical sources with little contribution
               from archaeological data. Two methodological problems account for
               this disparity. First, current archaeological chronologies for
               Postclassic central Mexico are not precise enough to document the
               structure and growth of this relatively short-lived empire.
               Second, the issue of diachronic correlation of archaeological
               data with the native historical record has not been approached
               with a consistent methodology. I address these problems,
               demonstrating that Postclassic chronologies can be refined when
               the appropriate methods (in this case, nontypological ceramic
               analysis and quantitative seriation) are applied. The resulting
               chronological sequence for western Morelos is correlated with the
               diachronic native historical record for the area. Because of
               these procedures, the archaeological record can for the first

               show these images in their walls. The motif was often depicted in
               Predynastic iconography but, due to some of its particularities,
               some authors suggested that hippopotami were, in fact, not killed
               but rather captured alive. Decades have passed, and evidence both
               ar- chaeological and archaeozoological has since grown
               significantly. We now have enough sources to reassess the corpus
               of evidence to debunk or ratify such hypotheses. Particularly
               relevant to confirm these was the finding at Hierakonpolis of a
               young hippopotamus’ remains showing signs of having been kept
               captive in the village. Moreover, it is helpful to examine
               evidence not taken into account by the authors such as
               ethnohistorical research and the latest archaeozoological find-
               ings. The outcome of this research seems to suggest that the
               killing of hippopotami did, in fact, take place during hunting
               expeditions, due to the danger of transporting the beasts alive.
               Further- more, the idea of iconographic evidence as a narrative
               of actual events should be challenged and understood instead as
               being one of symbolic nature.",

              patterning using two approaches: 1) by means of an experiment,
              comparing a control cutmark pattern to ten simulated highly
              fragmented sets of front and rear limbs using \%NISPcut as the
              quantitative unit, and 2) by quantifying an archaeological faunal
              assemblage using both the number of identifiable specimens (NISP)
              and the comprehensive minimum number of elements (cMNE). Results
              reveal significant differences in cutmark patterning between the

              ordinal-scale frequencies of cutmark anatomical portions

              that differences between the two quantification methods are

              fragmented assemblages, interpretations of butchering behavior
              based on cutmark patterning are influenced by the chosen unit of
              quantification. Overall, using NISP as the quantitative unit

               documents (inventories, databases, scientific assessments,
               interdisciplinary analysis, photos, drawings, etc.), which are
               mainly created by the museum that carried out the excavation, may
               not end up in the designated repositories. Instead, these
               documents are stored in the local museums that carried out the
               excavations and/or where the finds are kept. It is a major
               problem that there is no officially-appointed, centralised hard
               copy and/or digital repository in Hungary where all site
               documents are stored and made accessible. In this respect, there

               the archaeological community, or even central institutions, being

               documents in Hungary is the Archaeology Database of the National

              residential histories of individuals in the sample. Diet is
              determined by carbon- and nitrogen-stable isotope analysis of both
              bones and teeth; residential mobility is studied by stable oxygen
              isotope analysis. The results find no significant differences in
              stable isotope values between the sexes, between residential
              compounds, or between individuals with different burial
              treatments. However, children may have had diets with higher maize
              consumption than adults. Additionally, three individuals with
              childhood locations outside of Chinikihá are identified. This
              study contributes a nuanced understanding of the social structure
              of the ancient Maya elite, and at least in the case of Chinikiha,
              suggests minimal intra-household status differentiation in terms
              of diet.",

              precolombinos desde tres ángulos: el perfil taxonómico de los
              animales consumidos, la relación entre agricultura/ecología y la
              obtención de los animales selváticos y la reconstrucción de
              algunos fragmentos de la cuisine de los mayas, basada en evidencia
              zooarqueológica y tafonómica. La primera parte del texto presenta
              listas de animales vertebrados que pudieron haber formado parte de
              la dieta maya, debido a que sus restos se encontraron en basureros
              asociados a estructuras habitacionales. A lo largo del área maya
              se manifiesta un patrón semejante, sobresaliendo el venado cola
              blanca (Odocoileus virginianus) como uno de los taxa más
              frecuentemente consumidos. El uso de una gama reducida pero
              característica de taxa que se repite con cierta constancia entre
              los sitios precolombinos permite relacionar la caza de animales
              con el uso y la transformación de la tierra en el área maya. El
              cultivo de la milpa parece haber propiciado la presencia de
              determinados taxa, importantes para el consumo. Por último, las
              marcas en los huesos de animales encontrados en los basureros
              permiten suponer que en el área maya se utilizaba, desde tiempos
              precolombinos, un método tradicional de cocción conocido hoy día
              como píib. The present article reviews pre-Columbian Maya diet
              from three different angles: the taxonomic profile of the
              presumably consumed animals, the relationship between
              agriculture/ecology and animal hunting in the surroundings of the
              settlements, and finally, the reconstruction of some aspects of
              the maya cuisine, based on zooarchaeological and taphonomic
              evidence. The first part of the text presents lists of vertebrate
              animals that are presumed to have formed part of the maya diet
              because their remains were found in middens associated with
              residential structures. Throughout the maya area taxonomic studies
              emphasize the white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as one of
              the species most widely and frequently found in archaeological
              deposits. Also, the use of a relatively narrow range of taxa that
              are consistently found at most pre-Columbian sites allows us to
              relate the hunt of those animals to land use and transformation in
              the maya environment. Corn cultivation appears to have led to the
              increased presence of certain taxa that were important to the
              ancient maya diet. Lastly, the marks on the faunal bones excavated
              from these middens allow us to hypothesize about early evidence
              for a traditional cooking method, the píib, possibly used since
              pre-Columbian times.",

              exemplify this state of misunderstanding. Both studies argued that
              the role of bone density in shaping archaeological faunal
              assemblages has been largely overrated, but both based their
              conclusions on density values that were inaccurately derived. The
              former employed a method of calculating bone density that has been
              largely discredited over the past decade [J Archaeol Sci 29 (2002)

              the latter provided an assessment of the current state of bone

              discrepancies between available sets of density data as a
              reflection of the differences between two technologies—photon
              densitometry and computed tomography [J Archaeol Sci 29 (2002)

              tremendously in their accuracy. We review and evaluate the
              different techniques employed in the research of bone density
              patterns of mammalian fauna. Computed tomography produces the most
              accurate density data. For elements without medullary cavities,
              photon densitometry may provide density values of similar accuracy
              but only if a method of cross-sectional shape-adjustment is

  volume   =  33,
  pages    = "13--24",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This paper seeks to review the possibilities and
              difficulties in identifying rare diseases in ancient animals. Rare
              diseases are important in human medicine but seldom discussed in
              modern veterinary practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1348
              pathological archaeozoological remains, most published in the
              literature, are evaluated. With the exception of a few animal
              burials, the majority were recovered from food refuse: deposits
              composed of co-mingled, single bone fragments. RESULTS:
              Determination of population-based prevalence is not applicable in
              animal paleopathology, as almost all lesions occur on isolated
              bones. Moreover, grave hereditary diseases are rarely detected on
              animal bones because animals with such disorders seldom survived,
              except when humans promoted their rare inherited traits.
              SIGNIFICANCE: Rare diseases form a special category in human
              pathology posing both therapeutic and ethical challenges. While in
              wild animals natural selection tends to prevent the inheritance of
              such conditions, curious cases of animal morbidity have been
              brought about by domestication. Humans sheltered animals of lesser
              vitality and sometimes even promoted their negative traits.
              Understanding these phenomena in animal paleopathology will help
              fine-tuning the rare disease paradigm. LIMITATIONS: The definition
              of rare disease in animal paleopathology can only be assessed
              based on ancient and modern human correlates, and rare variation
              could become cultivated traits, ultimately developed into part of
              ``normal'' variability as trademark breed characteristics.
              Taphonomic limitations in recovering osteological evidence of
              debilitating hereditary diseases in animals are unlikely to
              improve. Suggestions for further research: Further research will
              need to focus on the scarce osteological evidence for rare
              conditions in light of differential diagnoses. The concept of
              ``rare disease'' may be worth expanding beyond hereditary
              conditions in animals considering fundamental differences between
              past animal and human lifeways.",

               extant archaeological data. Usually bone micro-fragments are
               gathered as a result, however, during archaeological analysis
               these remains are often set apart as indeterminate bones and
               generally do not contribute to the interpretation of the
               deposits. How to decipher archaeological palimpsests using these
               small bone fragments is the aim of this paper. El Mirón Cave,
               located in northern Iberia, contains a very rich Cantabrian Lower
               Magdalenian deposit (17?15 uncal ka BP) with high densities of
               faunal remains and artefacts. Here, we present zooarchaeological,
               taphonomic and spatial distribution analyses of macromammal
               finds, including those small bone fragments, accumulated during a
               series of intensive and repeated human occupations found in the
               outer vestibule excavation area. Our results show that a broad
               spectrum of activities was performed there, including meat,
               marrow and grease processing and waste abandonment. We propose
               that bone micro-fragments must be considered when addressing
               human subsistence reconstructions from animal remains, as they
               represent the leftovers of the chaîne opératoire of animal
               carcass exploitation. The archaeological implications of their
               inclusion are extremely valuable, especially when deciphering
               palimpsests. A multidisciplinary approach to study these small
               animal remains provides information that otherwise would be
               missed.",

              human parasite infection. Hookworm (Ancylostomidae) and whipworm
              (Trichuris trichiura) and other exclusive human intestinal
              parasites have been recorded in pre-Columbian America. These
              parasite species originated in pre-hominids and have accompanied
              humans across continents when people went out of Africa. However,
              for those human populations that crossed the Bering Land Bridge
              from Siberia to Alaska, cold climate conditions hampered parasite
              transmission. Alternative migration routes have been proposed to
              explain the presence of these parasites in pre-Columbian
              populations in the Americas. Other parasites were established in
              the New World long before humans entered the American continents.
              One such malady is Chagas disease. Chagas disease, caused by
              Trypanosoma cruzi, offers an example of how animals and humans
              have interacted in the past. Classical theory points to the origin
              and dispersion of human T. cruzi infection among Andean
              populations, starting with sedentary habits and animal
              domestication 6000 years ago. However, recent PCR results in
              mummified bodies outside the Andean region have challenged this
              theory. Pre-Columbian Brazilian mummies were found positive for T.
              cruzi infection, raising an alternative hypothesis on the
              antiquity of Chagas disease in the Americas. Paleoparasitology is
              a new tool to study past events, shedding light on human and other
              animal behavior, migration routes, diet, and other aspects of
              host–parasite environment evolution.",

               dedicated to marine components are relatively recent. Efforts

               middens? An overview of published data on crabs is presented here

               Researchers using photon densitometry have been unable to factor

               area, thereby significantly underestimating the density of long

              approach to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of
              variation in sub-aerial bone weathering in a British context.
              Weathering is one of the most common taphonomic modifications and
              provides a crucial line of evidence for reconstructing the
              taphonomic trajectories of faunal assemblages and archaeological
              deposits. It provides clear evidence for prolonged subaerial
              exposure, either prior to deposition in a context or as a result
              of later disturbance. In combination with other taphonomic indices
              such as gnawing, trampling, abrasion and fracture patterns,
              weathering can be used to reconstruct depositional histories and
              to investigate the structured treatment of different body parts or
              taxa. As a broad range of factors affect the prevalence and
              severity of weathering, weathering patterns can rarely be
              interpreted at face value indeed many variables such as
              predepositional microenvironment cannot be traced
              archaeologically. Other contributory factors pertaining to the
              structural properties of elements and taxa can be discerned and
              must be taken into account in interpreting weathering signatures
              although disagreement exists regarding which variables are most
              important in mediating weathering. In addition, for
              zooarchaeologists to interpret modification patterns, it is
              necessary for elements and taxa that are most likely to be
              affected by weathering to be defined. Deposits that are dominated
              by susceptible classes of remains are likely to exhibit greater
              modification than deposits that are not, even if depositional
              histories were similar. Through a combination of classification
              tree and ordinal regression analysis, this article identifies
              which archaeologically recoverable variables explain the greatest
              variance in weathering and which anatomical elements and taxa are
              most likely to be affected in archaeological deposits in the UK.",

              in archeological bone assemblages. However, modern bone damage
              data for most carnivore taxa are limited. This is particularly
              true for canids. This study presents bone damage data collected
              from feeding experiments conducted with Mexican Gray Wolves (Canis
              lupus baileyi) and Red Wolves (Canis rufus). This is the largest
              experimental assemblage reported for canids to date. The
              image-analysis GIS approach described by Marean et al. (2001) is
              expanded on here and used to document bone preservation and tooth
              mark distribution for the first time in a carnivore-modified bone
              assemblage. Further, we introduce the use of the ArcGIS Spatial
              Analyst to identify significant concentrations of bone
              modifications. Results show that the distribution of tooth pits
              varies considerably across elements as well as across different
              portions of the same element, and that significant clusters of
              tooth pits occur on all long bones. We suggest that with a large
              enough sample, the GIS Spatial Analyst can be a useful tool for
              analyzing the distribution of bone modifications with greater
              resolution than previous methods. This method facilitates
              comparisons between experimental and fossil assemblages which may
              aid in identifying the timing of access to carcasses by carnivores
              involved in modifying fossil assemblages. Finally, the use of this

               bones as a reflection of activity and other variables (references
               in Galloway et al. 1997; Willey et al. 1997), but seldom have
               they considered it as an intrinsic property of bones that has a
               significant mediating influence on a variety of taphonomic
               processes. Thus, the great majority of the literature on bone
               density as a taphonomically and forensically significant variable
               concerns nonhuman animal bones. In this chapter, I first briefly
               review the history of considerations of bone density in
               taphonomic contexts. Then, I turn to definitions of density as a
               generic property; this is necessary, because several different
               properties that more or less closely approximate the density of
               bone have been measured, but all have been called “density.” Part
               of the reason that different properties have been measured is
               revealed by a consideration of how density has been measured in
               ungulate and other skeletons. Historical review of the techniques
               used to measure density reveals strengths and weaknesses of the
               several techniques, provides guidance about how density might be
               measured in the future, and underscores why certain density
               values for human skeletal parts are better than others for
               taphonomic/forensic purposes. Subsequent to the historical
               review, I turn briefly to how to quantify bone frequencies in
               order to determine if some skeletal parts have survived
               attritional processes better than other parts. This leads to a
               consideration of how past researchers have analytically detected
               density-mediated attrition in particular collections. Then I
               present data on the density of human bones and work through
               examples of analytical techniques using real data. The discussion
               is concluded with a few thoughts on the future.",

              taxa (zebra and wildebeest) consumed by wild lions in the
              Tarangire National Park (Tanzania) has been used to determine
              element-specific lion damage patterns. This study presents a novel
              software for the 3D spatial documentation of bone surface
              modifications at the anatomical level. Combined with spatial
              statistics, the present analysis has been able to conclude that
              despite variable degrees of competition during carcass
              consumption, lions generate bilateral patterning consisting of
              substantial damage of proximal ends of stylopodials and
              zeugopodials, moderate damage of the distal ends of femora and
              marginal damage of distal ends of humeri and zeugopodials. Of
              special interest is, specifically, the patterning of tooth marks

              determine not only the type of carnivore involved in any given
              bone assemblage, but also the interaction with other agents
              (namely, hominins, in the past). Lions leave few tooth marks on
              mid-shaft sections, mostly concentrated on certain sections and
              orientations of stylopodials and, to a lesser extent, of the
              proximal tibia. Redundant occurrence of tooth marks on certain
              bone sections renders them as crucial to attest lion agency in
              carcass initial consumption. Indirectly, this can also be used to
              determine whether hominins ever acquired carcasses at lion kills.",

              the Maya area prior to the so-called Postclassic “mercantile”
              period. We suggest that market exchange was foundational to the
              stability of Classic era polities, and by extension, that it was
              of key strategic interest to dynasts and their retinues. We reject
              some of the prevailing dualistic views that the economic
              activities of royal courts or noble houses were disconnected from
              the vast majority of production and exchange activities deemed
              essential for the daily life of supporting populations with the
              sole exception of tribute payments. Alternatively, we postulate
              the accessibility and interchangeability of most products through
              market place commerce, as is well-documented for the Postclassic
              Period. Correlates of well developed market exchange that are
              tracked in our analysis include occupational specialization,
              surplus production, household and community interdependency, and
              ease of access to valuable goods. We compare these patterns across
              elite and commoner contexts at Classic Period Tikal to those of
              Postclassic Period Mayapán. The assemblages at Mayapán provide
              comparative indices from a city known historically to have had an
              important regional market exchange system. Similar patterns at
              Tikal strongly suggest time depth for market exchange, as well as
              a more complex market system than the solar central place

               constructing zooarchaeological indices and applying them to
               archaeological assemblages is also discussed. The results
               presented here were developed from a large sample of 46
               metacarpals and 45 femurs of modern guanacos, ranging in age from
               ca. 6 months of gestation to 12 years. Bone structural densities
               were measured using a biphotonic X-ray densitometer, DEXA method,
               Norland EXCELL and the bone mineral content (BMC) of each scanned
               portion or complete element was divided by its volume, which was
               obtained independently by water displacement. Our results
               indicate that the bone density of each anatomical unit is highly
               variable, even among individuals of the same species. According
               to metacarpals data, age is an important factor affecting BMD.
               Moreover, our study shows that the density ranges of different
               skeletal elements can overlap, suggesting that it is not possible
               to predict that a certain element is always denser than another
               one. Finally, we present new evidence about the potential
               age-related taphonomic bias in faunal assemblages, indicating

              deteriorated skeletal remains. To this end, we review age-related
              microscopic metamorphoses in thin sections of undecalcified bone

              qualitative assessment of histological tissue. In this essay, we
              evaluate the potential of these standards in three case studies on
              the deteriorated skeletal remains of three Mayan dignitaries from
              the first millennium CE. In the first case, the macroscopic
              approximation is confirmed by histologic scrutiny, while in the
              second case contradicting results lead to a discussion of the
              individual’s pathological conditions that could explain the

              osteon population densities for the rib, clavicle, and rib and
              clavicle combined are presented. Predicting formulas were
              generated from a sample of 40 individu- als of known age, sex, and
              race. Independent samples of 12 ribs and 7 clavicles were used to
              test the formulas. Mean differences between known and predicted
              ages were 1.1 years, 2.6 years, and 3.4 years for the clavicle,
              rib and clavicle combined, and rib formulas respectively. An
              analysis of variance found no significant differences among the
              means for predicted and known ages. Since the formula based upon
              rib and clavicle combined has the higher standard error and r2,
              and includes data from different bones, it should provide better
              overall accuracy and reliability, and is recommended whenever both
              bones are available. A number of methods have been developed for
              the estimation of age at death from bone histomorphometry (Kerley,
              1965l; Ahlqvist and Damsten, 1969; Singh and Gunberg, 1970;
              Thompson, 1981; Ericksen, 1990). His- tological methods have
              proven to be useful in constructing paleodemographic models and
              for forensic identifications, particularly when adult andlor
              fragmentary skeletal re- mains are encountered. The methods of
              Kerley (1965) and Ahlqvist and Damsten (1969) require complete
              trans- verse sections from major long bones (femur, tibia, and
              fibula). Since these bones are also suitable for standard
              osteometric analyses, there is often a reluctance to subject them
              to such invasive techniques. Singh and Gun- berg (1970), Thompson
              (19811, and Ericksen (1990) have developed methods that are de-
              signed to avoid this problem of invasiveness by requiring only a
              small core (Thompson, 1981) or wedge that does not bisect the
              entire shaft of the bone (Singh and Gunberg, 1970; Ericksen,
              1990). These methods are highly bone specific and require
              relatively precise selection of the microscopic fields to be
              examined. Since poor preservation, animal activity, or malicious
              intent often prevent examination of a partic- ular bone, it is
              highly desirable to have meth- ods available that can be applied
              to a variety of anatomical sampling sites. The purpose of this
              paper is to present the results of a study aimed at developing an
              age estimation method employing rib and clavi- cle
              histomorphometry.",

               the tendency is to consider compact bone a homogenous tissue,
               regional variations in microarchitecture are known to have quite
               different properties relating to processes of growth and
               mechanical loading. Specifically, we investigated an example of
               microstructural variation of the human, adult femoral endocortex,
               referred to here as the endosteal lamellar pocket (ELP). The
               femoral ELP is characterised as a histomorphological
               meta-feature, made distinct from general circumferential lamellae
               by its hemicircumferential lamellar orientation, medial
               positioning, radially oriented Volkmann's canals and decreased
               presence of Haversian systems. Our preliminary observations of
               mid-diaphyseal transverse thin-ground sections demonstrate the
               ELP as a regular meta-feature of adult human femora unearthed
               from the Maya archaeological site of Xcambo, Mexico. ELPs were
               easily identified in 38 of 45 examined individuals. Their size,
               shape and degree of secondary remodelling were variable. In
               comparison, ELP lamellae and those originating from the
               periosteum are divergent, or non-concentric in orientation. This
               divergence, along with the ELP's medial position, suggest it
               forms during growth through endosteal modelling drift. Possible
               considerations for ELP formation and persistence with age are

               dynamics during growth and activity. Further research is

               or indicators of mechanical loading. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley

               flourished over the Roman provinces as massive amounts of goods
               were shipped over thousands of kilometres through sea, rivers and
               road networks. Several works have explored these dynamics of
               interaction in specific case studies but there is still no
               consensus on the intensity of this connectivity beyond local
               trade.We argue here that the debate on the degree of large-scale
               connectivity across the empire is caused by a lack of appropriate
               methods and proxies of economic activity. The last years have

              were analyzed from the mummified remains of the Blessed Sante, a
              14 th century Franciscan friar from central Italy, with
              macroscopic diagnosis of probable brucellosis. METHODS: Shotgun
              sequencing data from was examined to determine the presence of
              Brucella DNA. RESULTS: Three of the 14 samples contained authentic
              ancient DNA, identified as belonging to B. melitensis. A genome
              (23.81X depth coverage, 0.98 breadth coverage) was recovered from
              a kidney stone. Nine of the samples contained reads classified as
              B. melitensis (7-169), but for many the data quality was
              insufficient to withstand our identification and authentication

              preservation and abundance of B. melitensis DNA present across
              multiple tissues, with calcified nodules yielding the highest
              number of authenticated reads. This shows how greatly sample
              selection can impact pathogen identification. SIGNIFICANCE: Our

               identifying tool use that archaeologists and anthropologists
               employ to determine the activities undertaken by both humans and
               their hominin ancestors. Knowledge of tool use allows for more
               accurate and detailed reconstructions of past behavior,
               particularly in relation to subsistence practices, economic
               activities, conflict and ritual. It can also be used to document
               changes in these activities over time, in different locations,
               and by different members of society, in terms of gender and
               status, for example. Both stone and bone tools have been analyzed
               using a variety of techniques that focus on the observation,
               documentation and interpretation of wear traces. Traditionally,
               microwear analysis relied on the qualitative assessment of wear
               features using microscopes and often included comparisons between
               replicated tools used experimentally and the recovered artifacts,
               as well as functional analogies dependent upon modern implements
               and those used by indigenous peoples from various places around
               the world. Determination of tool use has also relied on the
               recovery and analysis of both organic and inorganic residues of
               past worked materials that survived in and on artifact surfaces.
               To determine tool use and better understand the mechanics of wear
               formation, particularly on stone and bone, archaeologists and
               anthropologists have increasingly turned to surface metrology and
               tribology to assist them in their research. This paper provides a
               history of the development of traditional microwear analysis in
               archaeology and anthropology and also explores the introduction
               and adoption of more modern methods and technologies for
               documenting and identifying wear on stone and bone tools,
               specifically those developed for the engineering sciences to
               study surface structures on micro- and nanoscales. The current

              over 300 scarlet macaws (Ara macao), brilliantly plumed birds
              whose geographic origins lie at least 1000 km southeast in the

              However, automatic and quantitative methods (dental microwear

               examine the left maxillary fragment of the juvenile fossil from
               Mugharet el'Aliya, Morocco, found in association with an Aterian
               lithic industry. Previously, this fossil had been ascribed to
               modern humans or the Neanderthal lineage based on its
               ?archaic?/?Neanderthal-like? features and apparent large size.
               Here, we conducted a novel 3D shape comparative analysis of the
               maxillary fragment to clarify its taxonomic affinities with
               regard to its size and ontogeny. Materials and Methods Eighty
               Computed Tomography and surface scans representing ontogenetic
               samples of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis were used to
               capture species-specific differences. The toolkit of geometric
               morphometrics in combination with surface registration and an
               elastic iterative closest point algorithm were used to create a
               dataset of meshes with an identical number of corresponding
               vertices for the maxillae. Multivariate statistics were applied
               to Procrustes superimposed coordinates derived from the vertices
               of this dataset. Results Our analysis showed affinities of the
               Mugharet el'Aliya individual with our H. sapiens sample,
               especially with a subadult individual from Qafzeh. No
               size-independent affinities with Neanderthals of comparable
               dental age could be identified. Discussion Our results add to the
               evidence connecting fossils from western Asia, especially Qafzeh
               and Skhul, and the North African Aterian. Furthermore, Mugharet
               el'Aliya adds to our knowledge of the ontogenetic development of
               adult morphology that is frequently used to characterize hominin
               groups, for example, Neanderthals and modern humans.",

               Conversely, commercialized systems required investment in public

               “open markets,” where buyers and sellers from across social

              comparisons between the surfaces of purported archaeological bone
              tools and experimentally manufactured and used bones are
              complicated by taphonomic processes affecting ancient bone.
              Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to assume that bones within the
              same deposits are altered similarly and thus these alterations are
              quantifiable. Here we show how unworked bones can be used to
              quantify the taphonomic effect on bone surfaces and how this
              effect can then be controlled for and incorporated into an
              analysis for evaluating the modified surfaces of purported bone
              tools. To assess the baseline taphonomy of Middle Paleolithic
              archaeological deposits associated with typologically identified
              bone artifacts, specifically lissoirs, we directly compare the
              surface textures of ancient and modern unworked ribs. We then
              compare the ancient unworked ribs and lissoirs to assess their
              differences and predict the ancient artifacts’ original surface
              state using a multilevel multivariate Bayesian model. Our findings
              demonstrate that three of five tested surface texture parameters
              (Sa, Spc, and IsT) are useful for distinguishing surface type. Our
              model predictions show that lissoirs tend to be less rough, have
              more rounded surface peaks, and exhibit more directionally
              oriented surfaces. These characteristics are likely due to
              anthropogenic modifications and would have been more pronounced at
              deposition. Quantifying taphonomic alterations moves us one step

              found in the Mediterranean region, in open or partially-open
              landscapes in mountainous areas. They normally feed on mammals, up
              to the size of a hare, medium-sized birds and large reptiles. The
              remains of Bonelli's eagles have been found at Pleistocene
              archaeological sites, raising the possibility that they were
              active bone accumulating agents in caves and shelters, a practice
              evidenced by contemporary studies that show their nests are
              usually located on rocky cliffs. Taphonomic studies on prey
              remains consumed by these raptors do not exist and their role in
              bone accumulations at archaeological sites is not understood. We
              analyse non-ingested bone remains and pellets recovered at
              well-known Bonelli's eagle nests situated in the south of Spain
              and Portugal with the aim of characterising their accumulations.
              Specifically, we detail taxonomic and anatomical representation,
              bone breakage, beak marks and digestion damage. Results show that
              European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), red-legged partridge
              (Alectoris rufa) and pigeons (Columba spp.) are the dominant prey.
              The taphonomic pattern varies depending on the type of prey and
              the origin of skeletal materials (non-ingested versus pellets).
              Comparisons with other agents of bone accumulation (birds of prey
              and terrestrial carnivores) suggest that the taphonomic signature

              the key period of cat domestication 9,500-4,000 y ago. We report
              on the presence of cats directly dated between 5560-5280 cal B.P.

               lineage that traces the family line from its ancient origins to

              specialized practitioners to a large sub-discipline that is
              integrated with the larger field's research directions.
              Zooarchaeological analyses have addressed questions ranging from
              forager ecology to the processes of domestication to how animals
              function in the social realm. In each instance, methodological

              have altered the environment, a process that began deep in our

              Whether models obtained through photogrammetry can be used for
              zooarchaeological studies requires a systematic examination. In
              the context of research into dog domestication, we explore whether
              3D models of wolf crania, obtained through a photogrammetric
              approach, accurately describe the original cranium in term of
              colouration, texture and most importantly, geometry. To answer
              this question, we compared the topology of 3D models obtained with
              a high-resolution surface scanner (used as reference geometry)
              with models reconstructed from the same five wolf crania using
              photogrammetry. The pairs of models were then compared using both
              a visual, qualitative and two quantitative approaches. The latter,
              a geometric comparison computed the deviation map between the
              pairs of 3D models, which was then followed by a 3D landmark based
              geometric morphometric approach using corresponding analyses. Our
              results demonstrate that photogrammetry can produce 3D models with
              visually satisfying levels of morphological detail in terms of
              texture, colouration and geometry. In addition, the quantitative
              comparison of the models revealed an average distance between the
              two surfaces of 0.088mm with an average standard deviation of
              0.53mm. The geometric morphometric analyses revealed the same
              degree of measurement error for the two series of scans (2.04\%
              and 1.95\%), with only 6.31\% of the morphometric variation being
              due to the acquisition technique. Photogrammetry, therefore,
              offers a low cost, easily portable and simple to perform
              alternative to traditional surface scanning, affording advantages
              that make it a highly useful tool for zooarchaeological research.",

              non-destructive method, which has become increasingly used since
              the development of the digital camera. Recent studies have
              demonstrated that reconstructions of isolated elements can be of

              Indeed, access to material can be an issue in comparative anatomy
              and, especially, in paleontology. This is notably the case for
              large, impressive specimens. We performed reconstructions based on

              reconstruction performance of two software programs. The resulting

              Depuis la fin du XXe siècle, de nouvelles technologies ont fourni
              des outils puissants permettant de numériser des structures
              biologiques en trois dimensions (3D). Parmi ceux-ci, la
              photogrammétrie est une méthode bon marché et non destructive, qui
              a connu un essor avec le développement des appareils
              photonumériques. Des études récentes ont montré que les
              reconstructions par photogrammétrie d’éléments isolés peuvent être
              d’aussi bonne qualité que celles obtenues avec des scanners
              surfaciques. Ici, nous avons testé les performances de la
              photogrammétrie pour l’analyse quantitative de spécimens exposés
              dans des musées. En effet, l’accès au matériel peut être
              problématique en anatomie comparée ou en paléontologie ; c’est
              notamment le cas pour les spécimens de grande taille. Plusieurs
              reconstructions ont été faites avec des photographies prises dans
              des conditions différentes, et en utilisant deux logiciels
              différents, afin de tester leurs prestations. Les modèles 3D
              obtenus ont été alors comparés à un objet de référence : l’os
              étudié, numérisé avec un scanner surfacique de pointe. Les
              résultats montrent que la photogrammétrie permet une
              reconstruction de bonne qualité de pratiquement toute la surface
              de l’os étudié. La photogrammétrie apparaît donc comme une méthode
              fiable et parfaitement adaptée pour l’étude des spécimens de
              grande taille exposés dans des galeries de musées.",

              been primarily used to support claims of early animal
              domestication, perhaps most contentiously in claims for the
              existence of so-called “proto-domestic” dogs as early as the
              Middle-Upper Palaeolithic. Tooth crowding studies vary in their
              methodological approaches, and interpretation of the resulting
              data is constrained by the limited geographic and temporal scope
              of reference specimens used to construct an appropriate
              comparative framework. To address these key problems, we present a
              standardised landmark-based protocol for the measurement and
              quantification of mandibular tooth crowding that can be
              systematically applied in the context of dog domestication
              research. We then test the assumption that tooth crowding is less
              frequent in ancient and modern wild wolf populations by examining
              750 modern dogs and 205 modern wolves from across the modern
              geographic range of Canis lupus as well as 66 Late Pleistocene

              frequency of tooth crowding found in our modern dog dataset (∼6\%)
              in part reflects the ‘modern’ morphology of domestic breeds, the
              higher frequency of crowding in both modern (∼18\%) and ancient
              (∼36\%) wolves strongly suggests that current assumptions linking
              tooth crowding with the process of early domestication (at least
              in dogs) should be critically re-evaluated, and that further
              investigations into the drivers behind these developmental

              Equus asinus (donkey), have been found in archaeological contexts
              throughout Iberia since the Palaeolithic and Chalcolithic periods,
              respectively. These two species play different economic and
              cultural roles, and therefore it is important to be able to
              distinguish between the two species to better understand their
              relative importance in the past human societies. The most reliable
              morphological features for distinguishing between the two
              domesticated equids are based on cranial measurements and tooth
              enamel folds, leading to only a small percentage of archaeological
              remains that can be identified to species. Ancient DNA (aDNA)
              analysis can be used to reliably distinguish the two equids, but
              it can be cost prohibitive to apply to large assemblages, and aDNA
              preservation of non-cranial elements is often low. Collagen
              peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption
              time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, also known as
              zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), is a minimally
              destructive and cost-effective alternative to aDNA analysis for
              taxonomic determination. However, current ZooMS markers lack
              resolution below the genus level Equus. In this paper, we report a
              novel ZooMS peptide marker that reliably distinguishes between
              horses and donkeys using the enzyme chymotrypsin. We apply this
              peptide marker to taxonomically identify bones from the Iberian
              Peninsula ranging from the Iron Age to the Late Modern Period. The
              peptide biomarker has the potential to facilitate the collection
              of morphological data for zooarchaeological studies of equids in
              Iberia and throughout Eurasia and Africa.",

              interaction include age at capture and transport (before ∼3 y of
              age), captive duration (over 2 y), anthropogenic diet (staple was

               Medical records of 17 birds presented to Healesville Sanctuary
               with fractured coracoids were examined retrospectively. Nine
               birds were treated conservatively and eight birds were treated

              morphological characters have generally become less important for
              phylogenetic reconstructions. In recent years, however, the
              appreciation of morphological characters has increased, and they
              are now more frequently used in addition to molecular data to
              reconstruct the evolutionary history of cervids. A persistent
              challenge when using antler traits in deer systematics is finding
              a consensus on the homology of structures. Here, we review early
              and recent attempts to homologize antler structures and objections
              to this approach, compare and evaluate recent advances on antler
              homologies, and critically discuss these different views in order

              provenance biological materials has become increasingly common
              since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost
              four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using
              strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium,
              commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both
              producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present
              methodological challenges that researchers must carefully
              consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many
              archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant
              materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable
              strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if
              applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the
              most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research
              questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide
              more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time.
              Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most
              successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements
              as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are
              both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer
              specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the
              world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis
              into their research designs should expect to conduct primary
              sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine
              existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically
              utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate
              metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be
              archived in one of several online databases to maximize their
              usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely
              increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping,
              strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of
              provenancing.",

              permanent body modification have long been an important topic of
              interest in Andean archaeology. While previous studies have
              enriched our understanding of these practices among prehistoric
              Andean populations, the introduction of 3D surface scanners and
              geometric morphometric methods in archaeology enable us to examine
              head-shaping practices in novel ways. In this pilot study, we used
              a NextEngine 3D Laser Surface Scanner to generate high resolution
              models of artificially modified crania from four archaeological
              sites dating to the Archaic (2300–1600 BCE), Formative (500 CE),
              late Middle Horizon/early Late Intermediate period (LIP) (750–1100
              CE) in Chile and late LIP crania (circa 1350 CE) from central,
              highland Peru. Landmarks were recorded on the 3D digital models of
              crania and these data were analyzed to assess variation in vault
              shape within and between the samples. Results of the PCA analysis
              showed graphical separation of the annular, tabular erect, and
              some tabular oblique types even when gross morphological
              assessments proved challenging. We documented marked variation
              within the general modification type traditionally identified as
              tabular oblique, which suggests more detailed classifications
              within this type are needed. We also investigated how standardized
              (i.e., similar) particular cranial modification types were at each
              site, and results show that the coastal sites of Morro 1 and Playa
              Miller 7, and the highlands Huari-Vegachayoc Moqo site show higher
              levels of standardization than the other four samples. This study
              highlights the utility of 3D imaging and geometric morphometric
              methods for straightforward, objective assessments of cranial
              modification and levels of standardization within sites and within
              particular modification types. This has implications for
              understanding the broader social and cultural significance of this
              practice, such as whether there were shared cultural norms about
              how a head should be modified, which could have led to highly
              uniform modification practices and head shapes in the Andes.",

              difficult to separate osteologically. One species, M. gallopavo,
              was introduced from northern Mexico possibly multiple times. The
              other species, M. ocellata, is indigenous and was possibly
              husbanded though never domesticated. The two species are
              morphologically very similar, their size distributions overlap,
              and their responses to environmental conditions and human
              manipulation may have led to non-species delimited skeletal
              changes. Limited information has, so far, been available to
              distinguish the two species, and most analysts prefer to identify
              this group to the genus level only. However, the turkey is the
              only domesticated fowl of the New World, and is one of only two
              domesticated vertebrates in North/Central America. It was a source
              of food, medicines, feathers, and artifacts, an emblem of status
              and an actor in pivotal ceremonial events. Thus distinguishing

              and southern United States for light element stable isotope values
              of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Stable isotope values were

              Reflecting the water acquisition strategies of leporids, our

              Contrary to expectations, neither δ13C nor δ15N values are strong

              post-mortem fractures. INTRODUCTION - Determining the time of
              injury is an important but remains a challenging task in forensic
              anthropology. In literature, many descriptions can be found to
              make a distinction between peri- and post-mortem fractures but
              they are generally related to the post-mortem time frame.
              Characteristics that are more related to fractures in fresh
              conditions however, are not extensively investigated. AIM - With
              this research we want to improve the current knowledge on
              perimortem fracture characteristics by defining a perimortem
              trauma pattern, that may be useful to distinguish peri- from
              post-mortem bone trauma. MATERIALS \& METHODS - This study
              approached this issue from an experimental point of view by
              comparing perimortem long bone and rib fractures from human
              autopsies to both fresh and dry experimentally reproduced bone
              fractures. A three-point bending setup was used and the bones were
              fractured by a slow and fast load, with and without added
              compression in the case of long bones to control the variable of
              muscle presence. In order to visualise some traits clearer, bones
              were cooked or directly brought in contact with black Indian ink.
              RESULTS - As a result of our extensive research we defined new
              bone patterns in long bone and rib fractures with each their
              specific characteristics, different for dry and fresh bones. In
              long bones we defined layered breakage, bone scales, crushed
              margins, flakes with flake defect, wave lines, and plastic
              deformation as perimortem specific traits. With layered breakage,
              wave lines, and flakes as the most valuable traits. In ribs we
              observed peels, folds, longitudinal lines, incomplete fractures,
              differential fracture edges on the internal and external part of
              the rib fracture, and plastic deformation. Of which incomplete
              fractures, plastic deformation, peels, and folds are specific
              perimortem traits. CONCLUSION - The traits make it possible to
              differentiate perimortem from post-mortem fractures. Furthermore,
              some of the traits give information about the biomechanics of the
              fracture due to their location on the fracture. Additionally, in
              the case of long bones, flakes and plastic deformation may also be
              an indicator of trauma in intra vitam conditions, especially
              related with muscular reaction to injury, therefore narrowing the
              perimortem time gap. This might introduce a new timeframe; the
              intra vitam period, changing the anthropological paradigm. All
              these new insights presented in this study might be valuable for
              forensic anthropologists with their perimortem bone trauma
              analysis and may help them to solve complicated forensic cases.",

              examination of skeletal trauma, the contribution of the analysis
              by the forensic anthropologists is essential. Such an analysis
              helps determine whether skeletal injuries are temporally

              that were involved in their production. The aim of this study was
              to investigate the perimortem nature of various bone fractures by
              assessing their particular morphological characteristics. A total
              of 111 perimortem skeletal injuries observed in 16 skeletons from
              a documented skeletal collection and a series of forensic cases
              were examined for this purpose. The perimortem trauma investigated
              was limited to blunt force trauma. The absence of an osteogenic
              response remains a basic characteristic of a perimortem injury but
              not the only diagnostic criterion. It was concluded that fracture
              patterning, the morphology of fractured edges and the presence of
              particular skeletal and non-skeletal attributes may substantially
              contribute to the diagnosis of perimortem trauma. Postmortem bone
              alterations such as abrasion due to sediment action or whitening
              resulting from sun exposure, observed in certain perimortem
              fractures, can cause considerable problems in trauma analysis by
              removing important indicators of perimortem trauma.",

              injury and the associated fracture pattern in long bones is

              interpretation. The distinction between postmortem and perimortem

              first signs of healing can be detected macroscopically,
              radiographically, or histologically. Perimortem injuries may be
              distinguished from postmortem damage by examining certain
              attributes such as fracture angle and fracture margins.
              Additionally, the most commonly encountered taphonomic factors

              Additionally, the bone degradation rate in buried environment
              higher than that in the CTM environment. The average spectrum, PCA

               factors resulting in bone injury. Knowledge of the biomechanics
               of bone trauma allows forensic scientists to use bone fractures
               to deduce the type and direction of loading that caused the bone
               to fail. The strength of the bone is its ability to withstand
               loads without failing, and is dependent on its material
               composition, organization, and overall geometry. Loads can be
               applied in tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear, or a
               combination of these basic components. These loads cause internal
               tensile, compressive, and shear stresses on the bone. However,
               bone is a dynamic composite tissue that exhibits anisotropic and

               absorb, the bone will fracture. The type of fracture produced in

              economic, and/or symbolic factors which influence raw material
              acquisition and use. While biomolecular approaches can provide
              taxonomic identifications of bone or antler artifacts, these
              methods are frequently destructive, raising concerns about
              invasive sampling of culturally-important artifacts or belongings.
              Collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass
              Spectrometry or ZooMS) can provide robust taxonomic
              identifications of bone and antler artifacts. While the ZooMS
              method commonly involves destructive subsampling, multiple
              minimally-invasive sampling techniques also exist. In this paper,
              we compare three previously proposed minimally-invasive sampling
              methods (forced bag, eraser, and polishing film) on an assemblage
              of 15 bone artifacts from the pre-contact site EjTa-4, a large
              midden complex located on Calvert Island, British Columbia,
              Canada. We compare the results of the minimally-invasive methods
              to 10 fragmentary remains sampled using the conventional
              destructive ZooMS method. We assess the reliability and
              effectiveness of these methods by comparing MALDI-TOF spectral
              quality, the number of diagnostic and high molecular weight peaks
              as well as the taxonomic resolution reached after identification.
              We find that coarse fiber-optic polishing films are the most
              effective of the minimally-invasive techniques compared in this
              study, and that the spectral quality produced by this
              minimally-invasive method was not significantly different from the
              conventional destructive method. Our results suggest that this
              minimally-invasive sampling technique for ZooMS can be

              Plaza of the Columns Complex in the ceremonial center of the

              population of around 100,000 people at its height, Teotihuacan had
              to have a complex food system in order to feed its population.
              Interestingly, the largest mammal available in the New World, the
              white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), is a rare animal in
              Teotihuacan’s faunal assemblage. This research, which involves the
              study of deer remains, indicated that deer were not a necessary

              deer, turkey, and iguana, and other important but less frequent
              animals in the assemblage were dog, peccary, and brocket deer. A
              wide variety of local and non-local fauna were also recovered. Our

              buildings (temples, halls, shrines, and nearby houses) and the
              outlying domestic settlement zones. Four arguments are presented
              regarding Mayapán's animal use in this paper. First, certain rare
              mammals and marine species were likely obtained through trade.
              Second, evidence suggests that white-tailed deer were either
              raised in captivity or were carefully managed in habitats
              surrounding the city. Surplus deer meat and skeletal elements were
              major commodities for exchange and local consumption. Third, dog,

              conditions provide significant constraints and opportunities for
              human behavior. Paleoenvironmental studies are thus an important
              component of archaeological investigations seeking to understand
              the organization, development and decline of past societies. This
              dissertation develops a method of paleoenvironmental research that
              uses stable isotope analysis of jackrabbit and cottontail
              (Leporidae) bones to quantify aspects of the landscapes in which
              they lived. The project then applies the technique to a sample of
              bones excavated from four archaeological sites in desert
              ecosystems of North America to obtain information about
              human-leporid and human environmental relationships through time.
              Site locations include Pueblo Grande (Arizona, USA), La Ferrería
              (Durango, Mexico), La Quemada (Zacatecas, Mexico) , and
              Teotihuacan (Mexico, Mexico). Results are explored across multiple
              temporal and spatial scales to refine the method and improve our
              understanding of the long-term dynamics of social-environmental
              systems within arid and semi-arid landscapes. Results of baseline
              analyses on modern bones demonstrate significant correlations
              between stable oxygen isotope values and moisture variables
              (precipitation and humidity), and between stable carbon and
              nitrogen isotope values and temperature variables (min, max, and
              mean temperature), indicating the utility of leporids as
              paleoenvironmental proxies. Two primary conclusions result from
              analyses on archaeological specimens. First, results from La
              Ferrería leporids demonstrate changes through time suggesting a
              shift towards wetter conditions during the Las Joyas (AD 850-
              1000) phase, a period characterized by increasing population and
              new architectural construction. Importantly, these findings link
              social development in the region with environmental change.
              Secondly, results from Teotihuacan demonstrate rising carbon
              isotope values concomitant with the growth of the city, likely
              reflecting human modifications to the landscape, and falling
              carbon isotope values following its sociopolitical collapse.
              Notably, during the peak of population and complexity of
              Teotihuacan leporids from the residential complex of Oztoyahualco
              demonstrate significantly higher stable carbon isotope values than
              other contexts, supporting previous assumptions that residents
              there specialized in rabbit management or breeding. By using
              stable isotope values from jackrabbit and cottontail bones from
              modern and archaeological contexts, this dissertation improves our
              understanding of the baseline factors that influence bone isotope
              ratios and provides new information on the social-environment
              dynamics of the ancient New World",

              Krueger’s groundbreaking study demonstrating the potential of
              stable carbon isotopes from the mineral phase relied entirely on
              bone apatite samples from archaeological sites. Further effort to
              test whether diagenetic effects in bone mineral may be

              The sites are located in the northern Maya lowlands, and all
              faunal materials derive from cultural accumulations dated to the
              Classic and Postclassic periods (between approximately AD 200 and
              1500) of prehispanic Maya occupation. Identification and

              adaptations and harvesting/hunting strategies of vertebrate
              animals by the ancient Maya, revealing specifically different
              exploitation patterns at inland and coastal sites, each primarily
              adapted to the immediate local environments. While elite residents

              to create more nuanced models of New World vertebrate consumption
              that did not focus on domesticated animals (dog and turkey). Any
              single model of ancient food systems fails to represent how varied
              ecological and social contexts led to a complex web of
              adaptations, and here, it is argued that Teotihuacan’s arid,
              highland, and urban environment contributed to a distinct faunal
              acquisition strategy. Intra-site variation and diverse degrees of
              animal procurement and management were practiced throughout the
              site. For example, the low proportion of deer compared to the
              abundant evidence of rabbit/hare consumption suggests small-scale
              animal management and breeding programs in the residential
              complexes supplemented with opportunistic garden hunting and meat
              purchased through a market economy. Such foodstuffs would have
              been both more predictable and readily made available to organize
              large feasting events, a possibility that is strengthened by

               diplotaenia Gill, 1862) is widely distributed throughout the
               tropical eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California to northern
               Peru, including all oceanic islands. Artisanal fishers
               occasionally capture it today and its remains are recovered at
               pre-Columbian dwelling sites along the Pacific Coast of America.
               This paper addresses the advantages of using allometry to
               estimate size ranges of Mexican hogfish in pre-Hispanic
               archeological samples from two ancient settlements in the Pearl
               Island archipelago of Panama: (1) Playa Don Bernardo (PdB), a
               preceramic site (6.2?5.6 kya), and (2) Bayoneta Island (BY-10), a
               ceramic site (~1 kya). For creating the allometric model, a
               modern collection composed of 39 individuals covering a wide
               range of sizes and weights was used. All individuals have
               complete information about their total length (TL) and standard
               length (SL), which were recorded in millimeters (mm), and their
               total fresh weight (W) in grams (g). The TL of the sample ranged
               between 265 and 750?mm, and the SL between 210 and 487?mm. The W
               ranged between 273 and 3450?g. The most frequent bones (11) and
               otoliths were selected and 29 measurements were taken. The total
               length?weight relationship was W?=?2E?05 TL3.0857 with
               R2?=?0.984. In general, it was observed that the relationships
               between the TL and the bone measurements had a strong correlation
               (R2?>?0.95). At PdB, the mean reconstructed length was 289.6 mm
               (TL), and at BY-10, it was 283.6 mm (TL). The study of the
               archeological samples of B. diplotaenia could be used as a point
               of reference in modern ecological studies and fisheries

              the wider public. During the last decade, a broad array of digital
              technologies has been widely applied for the creation of
              three-dimensional images of animal bones, with a number of freely
              accessible collections being developed and published online. To be
              beneficial for academic and non-academic audiences, the creation
              of these collections requires careful planning, and more attention
              is needed in order to ensure their longevity in the web as well as
              their future usability. Drawing on an online workshop, organised
              by the Science and Technology in Archaeology and Culture Research
              Center of The Cyprus Institute, titled “Zooarchaeology in the

              dissemination and communication of digital data to the scientific
              world and the wider public. In addition, the paper highlights the
              need for a stronger collaboration between archaeologists and
              researchers from the Digital Humanities’ sector in order to

              fauna. The use of fauna with medicinal properties is a common
              practice since pre-Hispanic times. In the last decade, there has
              been an interest in ethnozoological studies in Mexico. Therefore,
              more studies are needed in order to gather information regarding
              the use of fauna with medicinal properties in México.
              Ethnozoological studies are necessary in order to discover new
              medications for human health. This review presents current
              information in terms of ethnozoological, conservation status,
              trade, toxicological and pharmacological effects of fauna used for
              medicinal purposes in Mexican traditional medicine (MTM), based on
              scientific literature. Future prospects for research with
              medicinal fauna are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              Bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing
              recognized books and peer-reviewed papers, consulting worldwide
              accepted scientific databases from the last five decades. Reports
              included in this review complied with the three criteria cited as
              follows: (i) used in Mexican traditional medicine for medicinal
              and/or magical-religious purposes, (ii) with experimental studies
              regarding the toxicological or medicinal effects and/or with
              studies exploring mechanisms of medicinal effects, and (iii) with
              information obtained from a clear source. RESULTS: A total of 163
              animal species, belonging to 79 families and 4 taxonomic
              categories, used for medicinal purposes are reported in this
              review. Medicinal fauna used in MTM come from birds (48), fishes
              (3), insects (22), mammals (49) and reptiles (41). The most
              versatile species which had the greatest number of medicinal
              properties were Mephitis macroura (21 uses), Crotalus atrox (17
              uses), Dasypus novemcinctus (13 uses) and Didelphis virginiana (13
              uses). However, 14 of the 161 species listed in this review are
              classified as endangered. Animal species are mainly used for the
              treatment of inflammatory, respiratory and gastrointestinal
              diseases. Furthermore, insects and reptiles are the animal groups
              with more pharmacological studies. Approximately, 11\% and 5\% of
              medicinal fauna have been tested in terms of their pharmacological
              and toxicological effects, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite the
              use of medicinal fauna in MTM, during centuries, there are a very
              limited number of scientific studies published on this topic. This
              review highlights the need to perform pharmacological,
              toxicological and chemical studies with medicinal fauna used in
              MTM.",

                  book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science.
                  Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a
                  lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many
                  other things besides. These are the skills that allow data
                  science to happen, and here you will find the best practices
                  for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use
                  the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and
                  reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to

              source of food and textiles in the ancient world. Investigations
              into the processes of domestication, improvement, and management
              of these animals underpin interpretations of the economic
              structures of ancient societies. Despite this significance,
              zooarchaeologists continue to face significant problems in
              determining the state of domestication of key taxa, or even their
              certain osteological identification. This is particularly a
              problem during the initial stages of the domestication process.
              Significant advances in the understanding of certain domestic
              livestock species (e.g., pigs) have occurred as the result of
              geometric morphometric analyses but the morphology of other
              domesticates have caused them to lag behind. This study provides a
              GMM assessment of astragali from ovicaprines (sheep and goats) to
              demonstrate its capacity to advance our understanding of the
              domestication process through its ability to differentiate between
              wild, proto-domestic, and domestic morphotypes of these animals.",

               Lakes region continued to rely on traditional wild animal
               species. A small number of cow, equid, and pig bones have been
               identified in Kowoj and Itza Maya Contact period contexts at
               Ixlu, Nixtun Ch’ich’, Tayasal, and Zacpeten; however, significant
               changes in regional animal use are only visible after the Spanish
               began to build missions in the region during the early 1700s. We
               explore the introduction of European domesticates to the region
               at the San Bernabe mission near Tayasal using faunal, isotopic,

               usuarios en la infraestructura hidráulica y la eficiencia en el
               uso del agua. Sin embargo, el Código de Aguas se ve cada vez más
               cuestionado por su asociación con la sobreexplotación de los
               cuerpos de agua para obtener ganancias económicas a expensas de
               las necesidades básicas y la protección ambiental. Muchos
               análisis han examinado los efectos del Código del Agua en la
               gestión del agua, pero han prestado menos atención a su
               gobernanza, o sea, a las estructuras institucionales, y los
               procesos de toma de decisiones en torno al recurso hídrico. El
               objetivo de este artículo es analizar cómo el Código de Aguas ha
               configurado la gobernanza, cómo esta gobernanza ha influenciado
               las relaciones sociales de control sobre el agua, y, a su vez,
               cómo aquellas relaciones sociales han consolidado el orden

               gobernanza, como la práctica de la regulación muestran la
               naturaleza y el funcionamiento del Código del Agua, se argumenta
               que abordar la gobernanza como el proceso de construcción de la
               regulación revela las relaciones de poder embebidas en el marco y
               su rol de privilegiar la acumulación capitalista y el poder
               político. Revelar las relaciones de poder en el diseño,

               expected, the greatest degree of isotopic variation is found in
               the Middle Classic period, but ``foreigners'' are not restricted
               to the well-known tombs in Mounds A and B, which exhibit many
               Teotihuacán material culture affinities. Only one skeleton has a

               vibrant plumage. This special issue brings together scholars from

               of the major trends in the scholarship on birds and feathers in
               ancient and colonial Mesoamerica. It then highlights the

              Remains from Procurement to Disposal By Kaitlin Crow The complex
              society of the Maya developed major city centers throughout
              Guatemala and Belize and into parts of Mexico, Honduras, and El
              Salvador. During the Preclassic (1200 BC-AD 300), the ancient Maya
              underwent major social and political changes that affected many
              aspects of their daily life. From these changes, emerged a
              highly-stratified society with extensive trade connections,
              hieroglyphics, and power structures that visually and physically
              separated the general public from elites in the Classic (AD 300-AD
              900) period. Though the Classic period is commonly researched, to
              truly understand how the Maya developed into these independent
              political city centers, thorough research needs to be conducted
              within the formative period of the Preclassic. Previous
              investigations of the ancient Maya usually focus around
              architecture, ceramics, and burials, however faunal remains and
              bone artifacts can also provide valuable information on their
              culture. Bone artifacts are of interest here due to their
              understudied nature and how their different functions determined
              who used them, which in turn, influenced where they are eventually
              found. Understanding the role that bone artifacts play within this
              formative period can allow archaeologists to recognize craft
              specialization development and how these artifacts, through
              creation, usage, and ownership, established further
              stratification. An intensive study of several faunal assemblages
              will be conducted to determine potential trends of crafting, use,
              and disposal of bone artifacts. This research will span several
              sites across the Maya world, deriving material from both the
              Preclassic and Classic periods, with",

               (Petén Department, Guatemala) uncovered a small-scale hydraulic
               system including stone-lined canals and reservoirs within the
               architectural core of the site. The abundance of other nearby
               potable water sources along with the elaborate form of the system
               demonstrate that it served an ideological rather than practical
               function. Artifacts deposited in the reservoirs support this
               interpretation. Moreover, the reservoir located in front of the
               site's royal palace contained the remains of at least 30
               individuals who may represent members of the royal court

               been an accepted phenomenon. Recent work has suggested that
               intact spines may have been used and that the symptoms resulting
               from envenomation were an important part of the bloodletting
               ritual. Zoological and medical research, however, indicate that
               stingray toxins pose a more serious threat to human health than
               mere pain and inflammation. Medical studies conducted to track
               injuries resulting from stingray attacks report that some
               two-thirds of all cases result in tissue necrosis. Reconciling
               the use of stingray spines by the Maya with the physiological
               effects they present is crucial if we are to understand how the
               Maya viewed toxic marine materials and why they incorporated them
               in their ritual behaviors. Correlations between political events
               and stingray spine use may hold the key for understanding how
               these objects were articulated into the larger social and
               political sphere. We provide a discussion of the effects of
               stingray envenomation and the health risks inherent to the ritual
               use of stingray spines as bloodletters among the ancient Maya.
               Finally, we offer some possible explanations for the role of

               resources and the circumstances for intensifying their
               exploitation have received little attention. Here we reviewed the
               stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of 390 human
               individuals from Middle and Late Holocene coastal sambaquis, a
               long-lasting shell mound culture that flourished for nearly 7000

               resources to the diet of some of these groups. Through the

               into smaller social units, coinciding with substantial changes in
               coastal environments. The spread of ceramics from ca. 1200 years

               distintct areas, the Malmani dolomite, the Hekpoort

               found to be significantly different. Strontium isotope values
               were then measured on tooth enamel of rodents from a moder barn
               ow (Tyto alba) roost in Gladysvale (67\%) versus those from other
               geological zones. We then measured strontium isotope values of
               enamel from 14 fossil rodent teecth from Gladysvale Cave. The
               average and range of values for the fossil rodents is similar to
               that of the modern owl roost rodents. Fifty-seven percent of the
               fossil rodent probably derived from the local dolomite, while
               others were brought in from at least 0.8 km away. A pilot study
               of 87Sr/86Sr ratios of fossil rodent teeth from Swartkrans Member

               and has great potential for elucidating more of the taphonomic

              adult and juvenile Amur Falcon Falco amurensis feathers to
              understand the migratory connectivity of this species. Using the
              OIPC (Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator) and a
              calibration curve for American Kestrels Falco sparverius we
              predicted the breeding range of South African Amur Falcons in the
              Palaearctic. dD values for juvenile feathers (mean 6 SE 5 58.1 6
              2.5\&, range 83.9 to 25.7\&) and predicted Palaearctic annual
              precipitation values indicated that juvenile Amur Falcons in South
              Africa originated from across their entire Palaearctic range. This
              rejects the leapfrog migration hypothesis and suggests the
              widespread movement of birds south, with a funnelling effect into
              the subregion where they become concentrated over a narrower
              distribution range. Adult dDf values were more depleted (37.4 6
              1.8\&, range 5 71.3 to 9.3\&) than predicted annual precipitation
              values for sites where feathers moulted in South Africa (20.2 6
              0.9\&) but there was no correlation between dDp and dDf. This,
              together with significant variation of d 13 C among sites and
              annual fluctuations in roost sizes, suggests that roost site
              fidelity is low in the overwintering range. Populations not
              confined to breeding sites in South Africa are able to move widely
              across the subregion, feeding on a broad range of arthropods that
              become seasonally abundant during the austral summer. Total
              population estimates for South Africa are significantly lower than
              global estimates so a significant proportion of the population may
              not overwinter in South Africa or global populations are
              significantly lower than estimated. In South Africa, roosts that
              number hundreds to thousands of individuals are often in large
              exotic trees, e.g. Eucalyptus sp. They are often tolerant of
              disturbance at roosts which may be of little concern for their
              conservation. Habitat changes in the overwintering range in South
              Africa though, particularly due to agriculture, afforestation and
              strip mining, may affect global population numbers. There is also
              concern over the persecution of birds along their migratory route.",

               metastases as isotope. At very high doses and in certain
               conditions, it can lead to osteomalacia characterized by
               impairment of bone mineralization. The osteomalacia symptoms
               resemble those of hypophosphatasia, a rare inherited disorder
               associated with mutations in the gene encoding for
               tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Human alkaline
               phosphatases have four metal binding sites--two for zinc, one for
               magnesium, and one for calcium ion--that can be substituted by
               strontium. Here we present the crystal structure of
               strontium-substituted human placental alkaline phosphatase
               (PLAP), a related isozyme of TNAP, in which such replacement can
               have important physiological implications. The structure shows
               that strontium substitutes the calcium ion with concomitant
               modification of the metal coordination. The use of the flexible
               and polarizable force-field TCPEp (topological and classical
               polarization effects for proteins) predicts that calcium or
               strontium has similar interaction energies at the calcium-binding
               site of PLAP. Since calcium helps stabilize a large area that
               includes loops 210-228 and 250-297, its substitution by strontium
               could affect the stability of this region. Energy calculations
               suggest that only at high doses of strontium, comparable to those
               found for calcium, can strontium substitute for calcium. Since
               osteomalacia is observed after ingestion of high doses of
               strontium, alkaline phosphatase is likely to be one of the
               targets of strontium, and thus this enzyme might be involved in
               this disease.",

              Michoacan affiliation. To verify and better understand the
              Michoacan relationship, 22 enamel and 19 bone samples from five
              E19-affiliated burials were analyzed to determine their oxygen

              Teotihuacan occur widely in the Lakes Region of north central
              Michoacan we obtained samples from several sites there for
              comparative purposes. The results show that most of the E19 people
              had passed their later years in the Patzcuaro Basin of the Lakes
              Region. Although in E19 the archaeological evidence of this
              relationship declined over time, the isotopic evidence indicates
              that Patzcuaro ties continued to the end of E19's occupation. It
              seems that the people of E19, originally Michoacanos, gradually
              adopted a core identity as Teotihuacanos while continuing to

              possibility that the inhabitants, who were craft producers, may

              reproduce themselves as a social group or their level of economic
              productivity. Bone δ18O and δ13C values provide a long-term
              picture of geographic identity and diet, and enamel δ18O values
              provide a snapshot of geographic location during particular tooth
              development. A considerable proportion (29 percent) of the
              Tlajinga 33 inhabitants grew up elsewhere, but the majority of
              these immigrants had dwelt in Teotihuacan for many years before

              differences are significantly associated with gender. The social
              position of foreigners appears to have been generally high. For
              example, the occupants of Tomb 50 appear to have come from
              elsewhere, possibly West Mexico, but foreigners were also found in
              lower status contexts such as middens. The stable isotope ratios
              reflecting long-term dwelling at Teotihuacan suggest that social
              status was achieved, which supports current archaeological
              evidence. Furthermore, the lack of dietary differences between
              immigrants and native Teotihuacanos may also imply political
              and/or ethnic assimilation.",
