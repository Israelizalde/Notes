              isotope signals from the mineral phase of archaeological and
              paleontological calcified tissues is based on the widespread
              understanding that enamel remains a relatively closed system,
              while bone does not. Twenty years ago, however, Sullivan and
              Krueger’s groundbreaking study demonstrating the potential of
              stable carbon isotopes from the mineral phase relied entirely on
              bone apatite samples from archaeological sites. Further effort to
              test whether diagenetic effects in bone mineral may be
              circumvented remains important because bone apatite yields dietary
              information about adult life-stages beyond the discrete snapshots
              obtainable from enamel. In this paper we re-examine the grounds
              for exclusion of bone apatite as sample material, using case
              studies drawn from three sites which differ in age and
              depositional conditions. We use 13C/12C, 18O/16O, 87Sr/86Sr, and
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy data from three
              sites (Reunion Rocks, Border Cave, and Makapansgat Limeworks) to
              show that, while enamel is not a closed system, it nevertheless
              retains biogenic isotopic signals. In addition, bone signals may
              be surprisingly well preserved where fossilisation pathways have
              induced ‘enamel-like’ crystallisation changes.",

              remains from archaeological sites around Parita Bay in central

              two good examples of the mutualistic co-habitation of humans and

              differences generated from known environmental parameters at these

               remain unanswered. This study applied ancient mitochondrial DNA
               and stable isotope (δ13C,δ15N) analysis to 55 archaeological
               turkey remains from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey
               exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different (sub)species of
               turkeys were identified in the archaeological record (M. g.
