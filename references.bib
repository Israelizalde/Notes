  abstract  = "The study of human-animal relationships provides insight and
               context to better understand the motivations behind past human
               behavior. Stable carbon isotope analysis serves as a tool to
               explore such relationships, particularly in the pre-colonial
               Americas where many domesticated crops utilize the C4
               photosynthetic pathway and display divergent stable carbon
               isotope values relative to wild C3 plants. By studying biological
               tissues of animals and humans, the amount of C4 foods in the diet
               may be used as a natural tracer and questions involving
               human-animal interactions may be addressed. This chapter (1)
               provides an in-depth overview of carbon stable isotope analysis
               and discusses both its merits and limitations in relation to the
               study of human-animal interactions in the pre-colonial Americas;
               (2) presents case studies from North and South America
               illustrating how carbon stable isotope analysis has increased our
               understanding of the nature of the relationship humans shared
               with both domesticated and non-domesticated animals; and (3)
               provides suggestions for future research.",

  abstract  = "The city of Teotihuacan (AD 1–550) was a major multiethnic urban
               center that attracted migrants from as far away as west Mexico
               and the Maya region. Past research in the Tlajinga district at
               Teotihuacan using oxygen isotopes from human remains estimated
               that nearly 30\% of the population of Tlajinga 33, a single
               apartment compound, were migrants. This study takes a
               dual-isotope approach (87Sr/86Sr and δ18Op) to reevaluate the
               proportion of in-migration at Tlajinga and includes data from two
               additional apartment compounds, Tlajinga 17 and 18 (n = 23). New
               results indicate that migrants comprised ~45\% of the Tlajinga
               population. Previously acquired radiocarbon dates combined with
               mortuary and isotope data suggest that immigration to Tlajinga
               was highest during the first centuries of compound occupation.
               Nevertheless, migration was a continual process throughout its
               history. Additionally, a new finding suggests that residents of
               Tlajinga 33 ingested foods with higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than did
               those of Tlajinga 17 and 18. We hypothesize that the
               incorporation of imported lime for the nixtamalization process
               skewed the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of human remains, a potentially
               important finding for future studies at Teotihuacan.",
