              From the time of earliest habitation, this environment provided a
              wide floral subsistence to its human inhabitants, notably
              documented at the cave site of Guila Naquitz. Light stable
              isotopes, primarily carbon and nitrogen, have been used in dietary
              and environmental reconstructions throughout Mexico and Central
              America. We report a large isotopic study of wild and market
              plants from Oaxaca that demonstrates 1) overlapping δ13C values of
              C4 plants, including maize, and plants that utilize the
              Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) pathway for biosynthesis, 2)
              the existence of a significant C4 grass biomass, 3) the lack of
              isotopic separation in the δ15N of legumes and non-leguminous
              plants and 4) the increase in the nitrogen isotopic composition of
              crop plants relative to wild plant averages. These four
              observations are potential complicating factors in interpretations
              involving the origins and spread of maize agriculture, the
              relative amount of maize in the diet and assessments of trophic
              level or meat contributions to the human diet.",

  abstract  = "The turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) represents one of the few
               domestic animals of the New World. While current research points
               to distinct domestication centres in the Southwest USA and
               Mesoamerica, several questions regarding the number of progenitor
               populations, and the timing and intensity of turkey husbandry
               remain unanswered. This study applied ancient mitochondrial DNA
               and stable isotope (δ13C,δ15N) analysis to 55 archaeological
               turkey remains from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey
               exploitation in Mesoamerica. Three different (sub)species of
               turkeys were identified in the archaeological record (M. g.
               mexicana,M. g. gallopavoandM. ocellata), indicating the
               exploitation of diverse local populations, as well as the trade
               of captively reared birds into the Maya area. No evidence of
               shared maternal haplotypes was observed between Mesoamerica and
               the Southwest USA, in contrast with archaeological evidence for
               trade of other domestic products. Isotopic analysis indicates a
               range of feeding behaviours in ancient Mesoamerican turkeys,
               including wild foraging, human provisioning and mixed feeding
               ecologies. This variability in turkey diet decreases through
               time, with archaeological, genetic and isotopic evidence all
               pointing to the intensification of domestic turkey management and
               husbandry, culminating in the Postclassic period.",
