              provenance biological materials has become increasingly common
              since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost
              four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using
              strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium,
              commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both
              producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present
              methodological challenges that researchers must carefully
              consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many
              archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant
              materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable
              strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if
              applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the
              most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research
              questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide
              more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time.
              Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most
              successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements
              as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are
              both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer
              specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the
              world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis
              into their research designs should expect to conduct primary
              sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine
              existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically
              utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate
              metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be
              archived in one of several online databases to maximize their
              usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely
              increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping,
              strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of

              palaeodietary research, the vulnerability of carbonates to
              diagenesis necessitates careful sample preparation. The most
              common preparation method involves dilute acetic acid treatments
              to remove highly soluble mineral contaminants. However, there is
              variation in both treatment time and acid concentration. This
              study addresses the impact of such variation on carbonate δ13C and
              δ18O, sample loss in solution, and sample Fourier transform
              infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characteristics. Samples of fresh and
              archaeological bone were treated with 1.0 M and 0.1 M acetic acid.
              Carbonate δ13C and δ18O, sample loss and FTIR characteristics were
              measured at treatment times of 4 to 24 h. The results suggest that
              4 h of treatment suffice to remove highly soluble contaminants,
              and that longer treatment times can lead to sample
              recrystallization. Some samples treated with 1.0 M acid showed
              unacceptable loss or possible recrystallization, suggesting that
              0.1 M acid treatment is preferable. However, the more dilute acid
              caused smaller shifts in δ13C and δ18O for all samples and
              treatment times. Thus, while 0.1 M acid appears to produce
              superior sample quality, it may not produce results directly
              comparable to those of 1.0 M acid treatments. This has important
              implications for the comparison of apatite carbonate stable
              isotope values reported in the literature.",

              there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild
              animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates
              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426–822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations
              within these felid populations further substantiates the
              postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated
              throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed
              from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have
              been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or
              delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and
              display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were
              routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to
              be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in
              order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes.",

              359 historic and prehistoric African humans, and modern and

              isotope ratios of collagen lipids from four bones are also

              collagen concentrations, lower carbon and nitrogen concentrations
              in collagen, and similar C:N ratios. Carbon and nitrogen
              concentrations and C:N ratios are relatively constant over a wide
              range of collagen concentrations. However, prehistoric specimens
              with very low collagen concentrations have highly variable C:N
              ratios, very low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in collagen,

              the most reliable indicator of collagen preservation is the

              New World, we propose that one criterion for domestication should
              be dependence on humans for food, a trait that we test through
              isotopic analysis of faunal remains. Stable carbon- and
              nitrogen-isotope compositions of bone collagen have been analysed
              for 24 dogs and 16 deer found in well-dated contexts from the
              prehistoric Maya lithic manufacturing community of Colha, Belize.
              The sample spans the Early Middle Preclassic period beginning
              1000–600 bc to the Terminal Late Preclassic period ending around
              ad 250. The majority of both dogs and deer come from middens, but
              three dogs come from cache contexts in buildings. The degree to
              which humans controlled the diets of these animals varies markedly
              by context and time period. The diets of midden dogs demonstrate a
              significant increase in the amount of C4(maize-based) foods and
              become more herbivorous over time. Because the midden dogs were
              probably dependent scavengers, this phenomenon might reflect the
              dynamics of human dietary change as the population at Colha
              expanded towards the end of the Preclassic period. An increase in
              the homogeneity of dog diets might also be indicative of either
              more restrictive human control over the animals or a reduction in
              the variability of resources used by humans. Alternatively,
              because the structure associated with the midden in which the dogs
              were found became more ceremonial in Late Preclassic times, the
              dogs from this period could be reflecting a general increase in
              purposeful feeding for ceremonial purposes. Dogs found in special
              (i.e. non-midden) contexts from both the Late Middle Preclassic
              and Late Late to Terminal Late Preclassic periods have distinctive
              isotopic signatures that strongly suggest a more specific
              occurrence of purposeful maize feeding. Evidence is provided from
              ethnohistory and Maya mythology that may explain their distinctive
              mortuary and feeding behaviour. We infer that all of the deer in
              the Preclassic period contexts at Colha were wild and procured by
              hunting because they consumed a herbivorous C3diet.",

              paper investigates the historical inflection point when humans
              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1–550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma’s zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological
              evidence for this practice in Mesoamerica. It also represents the
