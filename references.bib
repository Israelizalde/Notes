              there is increasing evidence that Mesoamericans managed wild
              animals for a myriad of purposes. The present study situates
              ritualized animal management of highly symbolic fauna in the
              broader context of Classic Mesoamerica by examining another core
              site, the Maya center of Copan, Honduras (A.D. 426-822). In this
              study, we identify two animal populations among the faunal remains
              from public and private rituals spanning the Copan dynasty. One
              population, with diets heavily composed of atypically sourced C4
              inputs indicative of artificial feeding, corresponds with the
              felids interred in Altar Q and Motmot caches. The second
              population is composed of felids and felid products bearing a
              predominance of C3 signatures indicative of a more natural dietary
              regime. As with Copan deer, species-specific δ18O variations
              within these felid populations further substantiates the
              postulation that an expansive faunal trade network operated
              throughout the greater Copan Valley and beyond. Animals routed
              from sites of capture into the mesh of this network would have
              been processed into pelts, venison and other secondary goods or
              delivered alive to centers of state power for ritual usage and
              display. Our data reveal that at Copan, wild animals were
              routinely brought into intimate contact with human settlements to
              be managed and physically manipulated in a variety of ways in
              order to fulfill ritual and symbolic purposes.",

              (87Sr/86Sr) for identifying migration within Lapita populations
              and their commensal animals, specifically the pig (Sus scrofa).
              Lapita people (ca. 3300–2200BP) were the initial colonists of the
              island groups to the east of the Solomon Islands, spreading from
              Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa within a few centuries.
              Mobility is assumed to have been an important mechanism for
              maintaining cultural solidarity between Lapita communities. It has
              been previously argued that Lapita populations became
              progressively more sedentary over time after the initial
              colonising events. Two Lapita sites, Kamgot and Balbalankin, from
              the Anir Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago are included in the
              analysis and fall within the Early (ca. 3300–3000/2900BP) and
              Middle (ca. 3000/2900–2700BP) Lapita periods respectively. Ten
              tooth enamel samples from Lapita human and pig teeth as well as
              modern teeth were analysed for strontium isotopes. The mean values
              for the individuals from both sites were higher than the
              geological value obtained for the Anir Islands reflecting the
              incorporation of marine-derived strontium into their tooth enamel
              taken up in their diet. Although the sample sites have similar
              environments there was a difference between the local ranges of
              the strontium isotopic data. One Lapita age pig and one
              potentially modern pig from Kamgot fell well outside the local
              distribution for the site and were considered to be non-local. The
              extreme distribution of the two outliers suggests they came from
              two geographically separate locations. The results from the Anir
              Islands when compared with strontium results from other
              prehistoric Pacific Island populations suggest there is sufficient
              variation between island groups in terms of the biologically
              available strontium to justify further research. The present
              results are discussed in terms of using pigs as a proxy for human
              mobility as well as an indicator for the ‘local’ range of an
              archaeological population by treating human and pigs as separate
              populations. Strontium isotopes therefore provide the opportunity
              to investigate migration in Lapita populations on a finer scale
              than was previously possible.",

              began to control animals not only as alimental resources but as
              ritual symbols and social actors in the New World. At Teotihuacan
              (A.D. 1-550), one of the largest pre-Hispanic cities, animal
              remains were integral components of ritual caches expressing state
              ideology and militarism during the construction of the Moon and
              the Sun Pyramids. The caches contain the remains of nearly 200
              carnivorous animals, human sacrificial victims and other symbolic
              artifacts. This paper argues the presence of skeletal pathologies
              of infectious disease and injuries manifest on the carnivore
              remains show direct evidence of captivity. Stable isotope analysis
              (δ13C and δ15N) of bones and teeth confirms that some of these
              carnivores were consuming high levels of C4 foods, likely
              reflecting a maize-based anthropocentric food chain. These results
              push back the antiquity of keeping captive carnivores for
              ritualistic purposes nearly 1000 years before the Spanish
              conquistadors described Moctezuma's zoo at the Aztec capital.
              Mirroring these documents the results indicate a select group of
              carnivores at Teotihuacan may have been fed maize-eating
              omnivores, such as dogs and humans. Unlike historical records, the
              present study provides the earliest and direct archaeological

              not extend south of central Mexico, making the species non-local

               turkey remains from Mexico to investigate pre-contact turkey

              over 300 scarlet macaws (Ara macao), brilliantly plumed birds
              whose geographic origins lie at least 1000 km southeast in the

              whether the Paquimeños actively bred these parrots or traded with
              Mesoamerican groups to obtain the birds. The δ13C values indicate
              that the macaws ate a diet of C4 plants, foods that were
              unavailable to wild macaws. In addition, δ18O data suggest that

              provenance biological materials has become increasingly common
              since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost
              four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using
              strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium,
              commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both
              producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present
              methodological challenges that researchers must carefully
              consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many
              archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant
              materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable
              strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if
              applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the
              most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research
              questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide
              more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time.
              Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most
              successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements
              as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are
              both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer
              specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the
              world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis
              into their research designs should expect to conduct primary
              sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine
              existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically
              utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate
              metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be
              archived in one of several online databases to maximize their
              usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely
              increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping,
              strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of
              provenancing.",
